## Book Cover Strategy

**Challenge:** Cannot use copyrighted book cover images for commercial ebook

**Solutions:**
1. **Text-Based Design**
   - Use typography and color to represent each book
   - Book title and author as design element

2. **Public Domain Art**
   - Maps, vintage illustrations, period-appropriate imagery
   - Ensure truly in public domain (pre-1928 or explicitly CC0)

3. **Original Design Elements**
   - Geometric patterns, textures
   - Region-specific color palettes
   - Icon systems for travel modes/themes

4. **No Images**
   - Elegant text-only layout
   - Focus on rich content over visuals

**Decision Point:** Discuss with user before proceeding
