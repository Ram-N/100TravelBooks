## 10. SUGGESTED CUTTING STRATEGY

### Step 1: Eliminate Obvious Cuts (~15 books)
- Incomplete entries
- Tier 4 wildcards you don't love
- Clear author redundancies (3rd+ book by same author)

### Step 2: Geographic Balancing (~15 books)
- Cut 3-4 China books (from 12 to 8-9)
- Cut 2-3 India books (from 8 to 5-6)
- Cut 2-3 Europe books (slightly overrepresented)
- Keep all underrepresented regions

### Step 3: Author Limits (~10 books)
- Limit authors to 2 books maximum (preferably 1)
- Exceptions only for truly essential authors (Theroux, Bryson, maybe Fermor)

### Step 4: Quality & Relevance (~10 books)
- Cut borderline travel books
- Cut very dated/obscure books
- Cut books with mixed reviews

**Result:** 150 - 50 cuts = 100 books

---

## SUMMARY

### Strengths of Current List:
✅ Excellent geographic diversity (especially Asia, Europe)
✅ Great mix of eras (especially postwar golden age)
✅ Good genre variety
✅ Perfect tier distribution
✅ Strong literary quality throughout

### Weaknesses to Address:
❌ BIPOC representation too low (7-8% vs 20% target)
⚠️ Women representation slightly low (25% vs 30% target)
❌ Caribbean/Central America severely underrepresented
⚠️ Too many books by same authors (Theroux, Bryson, etc.)
⚠️ Geographic clusters too heavy (China, India)

### Selection Strategy:
1. **Keep all BIPOC authors possible** (priority #1)
2. **Keep 32-35 women authors** (hit 30%+ target)
3. **Limit authors to 1-2 books each**
4. **Balance geography** (cut Asia/Europe, keep Americas/Africa/Oceania)
5. **Mix tiers** (20-25 Tier 1, 45-50 Tier 2, 20-25 Tier 3, 5-10 Tier 4)
6. **Prioritize complete, verified entries**
