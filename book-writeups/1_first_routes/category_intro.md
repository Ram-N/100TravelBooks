## I. First Routes and Foundational Journeys

Some books exist because the journey itself was unprecedented. Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, Humboldt, Darwin—these writers moved through worlds their readers could not easily imagine. The routes were new, the encounters formative, and travel itself was an act of primary discovery.

These books anchor the collection historically, but more importantly, they anchor it philosophically. They show travel at its most elemental: movement as the only way to know.
