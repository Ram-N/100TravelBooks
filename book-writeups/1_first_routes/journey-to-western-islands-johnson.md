### **[ The Author: Samuel Johnson (1709–1784) ]**

Dr. Johnson was the undisputed heavyweight of 18th-century English literature. He wrote the first definitive English dictionary. He was a man of massive intellect and massive physical presence. He was also a city dweller who famously said, "When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life." He was sixty-four years old, overweight, and partially blind when he decided to go to Scotland. He didn't go for the scenery. He went to study a way of life—the Highland clan system—that was being dismantled by the British government. He was a man of deep prejudices but an even deeper commitment to the truth.

### **[ The Book: *A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland* ]**

In 1773, Johnson and his friend James Boswell set out on a three-month tour of the Scottish Highlands and the Inner Hebrides. This was not a vacation. It was a salvage mission for a culture. The Battle of Culloden had happened only twenty-seven years earlier. The Gaelic language was being suppressed and the traditional chiefs were becoming mere landlords.

The writing is direct and incredibly scannable. Johnson doesn't care for "flowery" descriptions of misty glens. He writes about the "nakedness" of the land and the lack of trees. He uses small paragraphs to analyze the economy and the social structure of the islands. He has a dramatic flair for the loss of dignity he sees in the clans. He is particularly obsessed with the "Second Sight" and the myths of the local people. He treats these stories with a mix of scientific skepticism and genuine wonder.

He provides colorful detail about the hardships of the road. He stayed in drafty huts and crossed stormy seas in open boats. He writes about the "Clearances"—the mass emigration of Scots to America—with a sense of grim foreboding. He knew he was looking at a world that would soon be gone. It is a book about the collision of the Enlightenment and the Middle Ages.
