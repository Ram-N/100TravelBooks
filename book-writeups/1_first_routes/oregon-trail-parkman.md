### **[ The Author: Francis Parkman (1823–1893) ]**

Francis Parkman was a wealthy young man from Boston with a serious case of "frontier fever." He was a scholar and a historian. He was also plagued by terrible health. His eyes were weak and his nerves were frayed. He decided that the best cure was a summer of brutal physical hardship. He didn't want to see cities. He wanted to see the buffalo and the Native Americans in their prime. He was a man of his time. He was often arrogant and biased. But he was also a brilliant observer with a gift for capturing a world that was about to disappear.

### **[ The Book: *The Oregon Trail* ]**

This book is a bit of a trick. Parkman didn't actually go to Oregon. He traveled from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains and back. His publisher added "Oregon" to the title because it was a trendy word in 1846. The book is not about settlers in covered wagons. It is about Parkman and his cousin, Quincy Adams Shaw, riding horses across the vast sea of grass.

The writing is conversational and full of dramatic flair. Parkman describes the heat of the plains and the sudden, violent thunderstorms. He has a colorful way of describing the buffalo hunts. He makes you hear the roar of the hooves and the whistling of the arrows. He uses small paragraphs to capture the tension of meeting a war party on the open trail.

The heart of the book is the time he spent living with a band of Oglala Sioux. He stayed in their lodges and ate their food. He watched their dances and listened to their stories. He writes with a raw honesty about the grit and the beauty of their lives. He knew that the wave of white settlers was coming. He knew that the "wild" West he loved was being pushed into the Pacific. This book is his attempt to bottle that wildness before the cork was popped.
