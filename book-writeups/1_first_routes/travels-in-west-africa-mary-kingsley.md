### **[ The Author: Mary Kingsley (1862–1900) ]**

Mary Kingsley was a woman who escaped a suffocating life. For thirty years she stayed at home in England to care for her invalid parents. When they died she was suddenly free and she had a small inheritance. Instead of getting married she bought a black silk dress and a pith helmet and headed for West Africa. She was not a missionary or a government official. She went to collect fish and insects for the British Museum and to study "fetish" (indigenous religions). She was a woman of incredible wit and iron nerves. She refused to change her heavy Victorian skirts even when she was wading through waist-deep mud or falling into elephant pits.

### **[ The Book: *Travels in West Africa* ]**

This book is a massive and magnificent account of her two journeys through the French Congo and the British colonies in the 1890s. It is one of the funniest and most intelligent travel books ever written. Kingsley does not write like a typical colonial explorer. She does not look down on the people she meets. She lived with the Fang people—who were then feared as cannibals—and she treated them with respect and curiosity.

The writing is full of colorful detail and a dramatic flair for the ridiculous. She describes fighting off a crocodile with a paddle as if it were a minor social inconvenience. She writes about the "spiritual atmosphere" of the jungle with deep seriousness but she also mocks the pomposity of the European traders. She uses small paragraphs to describe the bizarre insects and the suffocating heat of the mangrove swamps.

The climax of the book is her ascent of Mount Cameroon. She was the first European woman to reach the summit. She did it in the middle of a storm while her local guides were ready to turn back. She didn't do it for the glory. She did it because she wanted to see what was on the other side. She captures the "terrible beauty" of the African landscape in a way that feels modern and alive.

She was a fierce critic of the colonial government and the missionaries. She believed they were destroying African cultures they didn't understand. She saw herself as a "trader" at heart and she felt a deep kinship with the African people who lived by the river. This book is a record of a woman who finally found herself in the middle of a jungle.
