### **[ The Journey ]**

Kira Salak did not just want to travel. She wanted to test the very limits of her soul. In 2002 she became the first documented person to kayak solo 600 miles down the Niger River. Her destination was the fabled city of Timbuktu. She followed the trail of Mungo Park. He was an 18th century explorer who died trying to master the same river. Salak faced the same brutal elements that claimed him.

The journey was a constant battle against nature and human nature. She paddled through apocalyptic storms in the rainy season. She dodged hippos and whitecaps that tried to flip her red inflatable kayak. The heat was a physical weight. It often climbed above 110 degrees. She dealt with dysentery and men who chased her in canoes.

Salak stayed in remote mud hut villages along the banks. She met sorceresses and fishermen who had never seen a white woman alone on the river. Her prose is sharp and honest. She does not hide her fear or her frustration. This is not a vacation. It is a meditation on self-mastery.

The end of the trip brought a different kind of challenge. In Timbuktu she used gold to buy the freedom of two enslaved women. It was a final act of purpose in a journey defined by struggle. Salak proves that the greatest discoveries are often found within the traveler.
