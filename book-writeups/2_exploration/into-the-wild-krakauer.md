### **[ The Author: Jon Krakauer (b. 1954) ]**

Jon Krakauer is an American mountaineer and investigative writer who specializes in the intersection of human obsession and the natural world. He knows the territory. Having survived his own reckless solo climbs in Alaska as a young man, he brings a participant’s empathy to his subjects. He doesn't just report on disasters; he dissects the psychological machinery that drives people to take fatal risks. Krakauer is a master of the "investigative memoir," blending cold, hard facts with a deep understanding of the lure of the wilderness.

### **[ The Book: *Into the Wild* ]**

This book is a reconstruction of the short, puzzling life of Christopher McCandless. In 1990, after graduating from Emory University, McCandless gave away his $24,000 savings, abandoned his car, and reinvented himself as "Alexander Supertramp." For two years, he drifted across the American West, seeking what he called a "climactic battle to kill the false being within."

The writing is direct, haunting, and filled with dramatic flair. Krakauer uses small paragraphs to track McCandless's movements through the Mojave Desert, the grain elevators of South Dakota, and the canyons of the Colorado River. He provides colorful detail about the people McCandless met—drifters, rubber-tramps, and lonely retirees who were all captivated by the young man's intensity.

The story reaches its climax on the Stampede Trail in Alaska. McCandless walked into the bush with a small-caliber rifle and a ten-pound bag of rice, eventually taking shelter in an abandoned bus. He lived there for 113 days before starving to death.

Krakauer braids this narrative with his own history and the stories of other "seekers" who went into the wild and never came back. He avoids judging McCandless as merely "crazy." Instead, he presents a moral inquiry into the American myth of self-reliance and the high price of pure idealism. It is a story about the search for authenticity and the tragic fact that the wilderness does not care about your intentions.
