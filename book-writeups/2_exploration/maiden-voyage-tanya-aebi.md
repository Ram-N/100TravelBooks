### **[ The Author: Tania Aebi (1966–Present) ]**

In 1985, Tania Aebi was an eighteen-year-old high school dropout in New York City with no direction and no interest in college. Her father gave her a radical ultimatum: he would pay for her university education, or he would buy her a 26-foot sailboat on the condition that she sail it around the world—alone. Tania chose the boat, despite having almost no sailing experience. She set off with a cat named Tarzoon and a sextant, becoming the first American woman and the youngest person (at the time) to circumnavigate the globe solo. She is a writer of raw honesty, capturing the terrifying transition from a sheltered girl to a seasoned mariner.

### **[ The Book: *Maiden Voyage* ]**

This is not just a book about "how to sail"; it is a psychological portrait of solitude and growth. Tania spent twenty-seven months at sea, covering 27,000 miles in her small sloop, *Varne 27*.

The writing is direct, gritty, and deeply personal. Unlike many nautical writers who focus on technical jargon, Tania focuses on the emotional toll. She uses small paragraphs to describe the claustrophobia of a tiny cabin and the crushing weight of responsibility when something breaks in the middle of the ocean. She has a dramatic flair for describing the weather—the sudden, violent squalls that turn her world upside down and the eerie, beautiful calms where the sea looks like glass.

She provides colorful detail about the "cruising" community she met in ports like Tahiti and Darwin. She writes about the paradox of the solo sailor: the desperate longing for human contact followed by the overwhelming urge to be back on the horizon alone. She doesn't hide her mistakes—the navigational errors, the loneliness, and the times she wanted to quit. It is a story of a woman who found her spine in the salt spray and learned that freedom is something you have to earn.

### **[ The Signature Line ]**

> "The sea doesn't care who you are or what you've done. It only cares if you're paying attention."
