### **[ The Author: Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874–1922) ]**

Sir Ernest Shackleton was a giant of the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration." Unlike his contemporaries who sought the glory of being "first," Shackleton is remembered for his miraculous ability to keep his men alive. He was a charismatic, deeply empathetic leader who famously prioritized the safety of his crew over the success of his mission. His leadership style is still studied today in business schools as the gold standard for "crisis management."

### **[ The Book: *South* ]**

*South* is the firsthand account of the ill-fated *Endurance* expedition (1914–1917). The goal was to cross the Antarctic continent on foot, but the ship became trapped in pack ice and was eventually crushed. What follows is perhaps the greatest survival story in human history: Shackleton and his 27 men lived on drifting ice floes for months, eventually making a desperate 800-mile journey across the world's most dangerous ocean in a tiny lifeboat to reach help. Shackleton did not lose a single man.
