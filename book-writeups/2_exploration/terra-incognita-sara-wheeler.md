### **[ The Author: Sara Wheeler (1961–Present) ]**

Sara Wheeler was born in Bristol in 1961 and she is an English writer who clearly loves the cold. She studied at Oxford and spent years wandering the globe before finding her true calling at the ends of the earth. She made history by being the first female writer in residence that the Americans ever invited to Antarctica. Wheeler has a rare talent for finding the human soul in the most frozen places. She also wrote a famous biography of the explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard. She lives in London today but her heart seems to stay near the poles.

### **[ The Book: *Terra Incognita* ]**

Sara Wheeler did not just go to Antarctica for a weekend. She stayed for seven months. She lived in tiny rooms and shared meals with scientists who were often more interested in penguins than people. She traveled from the loud and crowded McMurdo Station to the absolute silence of the South Pole. She even slept in the same wooden bunk where Captain Scott once rested before his final journey.

The book is not just about the cold. It is a deep dive into what happens to a person when they are surrounded by nothing but white. Wheeler writes about the history of the men who died trying to reach the pole. She compares her own small struggles to their epic tragedies. She finds a strange kind of peace in the wind and the snow.

She looks at the world of the scientists she calls "beards" with a sharp and funny eye. She talks about the smell of old socks and the taste of canned food. She describes the landscape as a place of unearthly beauty and stubborn mystery. It is a story about finding yourself when there is nowhere else to hide.

She also deals with being a woman in a world that was built by men. She handles it with a dry wit and a refusal to be pushed around. She shows that the spirit does not care about gender when it faces the infinite. This is not a dry report or a simple diary. It is a lyrical look at what it means to be human at the very edge of the earth. She makes the impossible landscape feel like a character with its own moods and secrets.
