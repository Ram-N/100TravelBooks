### **[ The Author: Apsley Cherry-Garrard (1886–1959) ]**

Cherry was only twenty-four years old when he joined Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. He was the youngest member of the scientific staff. He was a shy man with bad eyesight but he had a core of pure steel. He survived the expedition while many of his friends did not. He spent the rest of his life haunted by the "what ifs" of the journey. He wrote this book as a way to process the grief and the glory of those frozen years. It is widely considered the greatest travel book ever written.

### **[ The Book: *The Worst Journey in the World* ]**

The title of this book is not an exaggeration. It refers to a specific three-man mission during the Antarctic winter of 1911. Cherry and two others walked sixty miles in total darkness to collect Emperor penguin eggs. They believed these eggs held the secret to evolution. The temperature dropped to minus seventy-seven degrees. Their clothes froze into solid armor. Their teeth literally shattered from the cold.

They slept in a stone hut that was buried by a blizzard. The wind blew their roof away and they lay in their sleeping bags waiting for death. Somehow they survived. They walked back to the main base carrying the eggs like holy relics. The irony is brutal. When Cherry finally took the eggs to a museum in London years later the scientists there barely looked at them.

The second half of the book covers Scott’s famous race to the South Pole. Cherry was part of the support team that saw Scott off. He describes the long wait for the men to return. He tells the story of how Scott found the Norwegian flag already flying at the Pole. The journey back was a slow march toward the grave.

Cherry writes with a beautiful and tragic honesty. He does not try to hide the mistakes that were made. He talks about the ponies that died and the food that ran out. He describes the final days of Scott and Wilson and Bowers in their tent. He was one of the men who found their bodies months later. This is a story about the limits of human bravery. It shows that sometimes the greatest victories are found in the middle of a total disaster.
