### **[ The Author: Patrick Leigh Fermor (1915–2011) ]**

Patrick "Paddy" Leigh Fermor was perhaps the greatest travel stylist of the 20th century. Expelled from school for being "a dangerous mixture of sophistication and recklessness," he set out in 1933 to walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople. He carried a rucksack, a volume of Horace, and a few letters of introduction. During WWII, he became a legend as a special forces officer in occupied Crete, where he famously kidnapped a German general. He spent his later life in Greece, writing in a prose style so rich it has been described as "tapestry-like." He was a man of immense charm, a linguist, and a soldier-scholar who lived several lifetimes in one.

### **[ The Book: *A Time of Gifts* ]**

Written forty years after the event but based on his original notebooks, this book covers the first leg of his epic trek. It is a masterpiece of memory, capturing a Europe that was about to be obliterated.

The writing is lush, direct, and packed with dramatic flair. Fermor describes sleeping in haystacks one night and in the candlelit schlosses of counts and barons the next. He uses small paragraphs to pivot from the architecture of a baroque cathedral to the crude slogans of the early Nazi movement. He has a gift for colorful detail: the frost on a barge, the taste of dark beer in a student tavern, and the intricate heraldry in a monastery library.

He provides a vivid portrait of a "vanished world." Because he wrote the book decades later, he weaves in an elegiac tone; he knows that the friendly monks and eccentric aristocrats he meets are standing on the edge of a cataclysm. He captures the "Mittel-Europa" of rivers, woods, and ancient rituals just before the storm broke. It is a story of a boy growing into a man by reading his way across a continent.

> "The true subject of the journey was not a line on a map, but the way a young mind absorbs the world just before it changes forever."
