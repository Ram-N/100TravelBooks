### **[ The Author: Cees Nooteboom (1933–Present) ]**

Cees Nooteboom is a giant of Dutch literature. He is a poet and a novelist who has spent his life living out of a suitcase. He travels with a deep hunger for the past. He does not just look at a building. He talks to it. He wants to know the secrets of the people who built it. He is a man who loves the quiet corners of Europe. He has been mentioned for the Nobel Prize many times. He writes with the precision of a poet and the curiosity of a child.

### **[ The Book: *Roads to Santiago* ]**

The title of this book is a bit of a trick. You might expect a diary of a pilgrim walking the famous Camino de Santiago. You would be wrong. Nooteboom is not walking. He is driving his car. And he is not going in a straight line. He is a master of the detour. The Dutch title actually translates to *The Detour to Santiago*. That is a much better description.

He spends decades wandering through Spain. He zigzags from the Pyrenees to the deep south and back again. Santiago de Compostela is just an excuse to be on the road. He treats the map like a menu. He picks the places that sound interesting and ignores the rest. He is obsessed with the empty spaces of Spain. He loves the dry and dusty heart of the country where the tourists rarely go.

He hunts for Romanesque churches. He describes the stone arches and the silent statues with incredible detail. He makes old stones feel alive. He chases the ghosts of dead kings and forgotten monks. He has a serious crush on the painter Francisco de Zurbarán. He writes about Zurbarán’s monks in their white robes with a glowing intensity. He sees the history of Spain as a mix of gold and blood.

The writing is dense but very personal. Nooteboom is a guide who whispers in your ear. He tells you to look at the light on a wall or the expression on a saint's face. He is fascinated by the Spanish obsession with death. He finds it in the art and in the landscape. This is a book for people who love to get lost. It shows that the journey really is more important than the destination.
