### **[ The Journey ]**

Alan Booth decided to do the impossible. In 1977 he stepped off the southern tip of Japan at Cape Sata and started walking. He didn't stop until he hit the northern coast four months later. He carried everything he needed on his back. He was a giant of an Englishman in a country of small spaces. He didn't want the Japan of the guidebooks. He wanted the mud and the sweat and the smell of woodsmoke.

The walk was a marathon of the soul. He pushed through blistering heat and mountains that seemed to go on forever. He wasn't looking for Zen temples or fancy tea ceremonies. He wanted to talk to the farmers and the shopkeepers. He wanted to know what made the country tick. His Japanese was perfect but he was still a stranger. People looked at him like he had fallen from the sky.

He writes with a wit that is as sharp as a razor. He describes the endless rain and the cheap sake and the kindness of strangers. He shows us a Japan that is fading away. It is a place of grit and beauty. He doesn't sugarcoat anything. He tells the truth about the exhaustion and the loneliness. By the time he reaches the end he is a different man. The road has stripped him down and built him back up.
