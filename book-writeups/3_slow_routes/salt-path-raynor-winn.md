### **[ The Author: Raynor Winn (1962–Present) ]**

Raynor Winn was not a professional explorer or a mountain climber. She was a woman who lived a quiet life on a farm in Wales. Within a single week, her world was ripped apart. She lost her home and her livelihood in a bad legal battle. At the same moment, her husband Moth was diagnosed with a terminal brain disease. They were fifty years old and they had nowhere to go. Raynor is a writer of incredible grit. She writes with a blunt honesty that makes you feel the salt on your skin and the ache in your bones.

### **[ The Book: *The Salt Path* ]**

This is a story about the power of the natural world to hold a person together. Raynor and Moth didn't go to a shelter. They bought a cheap tent and two thin sleeping bags. They decided to walk the South West Coast Path. It is 630 miles of the most beautiful and brutal coastline in England.

The writing is conversational and very direct. Raynor doesn't use flowery language to hide the reality of being homeless. She describes the hunger and the constant search for water. She writes about the "vibe" of being a person on the edge of society. Most people see them as "tramps" instead of hikers. She captures the dramatic flair of the weather and the crashing Atlantic waves.

She uses small paragraphs to mirror the rhythm of their steps. There is a lot of colorful detail about the people they meet on the trail. Some are kind and some are cruel. The real heart of the book is her relationship with Moth. As they walk, something strange happens. The man who was supposed to be dying starts to find a new kind of strength.

This is not a guidebook. It is a survival story. It shows that home is not always a building with a roof. Sometimes home is just the person walking next to you on a narrow path between the land and the sea.
