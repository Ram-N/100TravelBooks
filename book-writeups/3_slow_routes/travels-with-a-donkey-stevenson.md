### **[ The Author: Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) ]**

Before he wrote *Treasure Island*, Robert Louis Stevenson was a young Scotsman with bad lungs and a broken heart. He was in love with a married woman who had returned to America. He was restless. He decided to walk across the Cévennes mountains in southern France to find some peace. Stevenson was a man who noticed the small things. He had a dramatic flair for describing his own misery and he was one of the first writers to make the "process" of travel more interesting than the destination.

### **[ The Book: *Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes* ]**

This is one of the most famous travel books ever written. In 1878, Stevenson set off from Le Monastier with a donkey named Modestine. She was a small, mouse-colored animal about the size of a dog. She was also incredibly slow. Stevenson spent the first few days of the trip in a state of sheer rage because he could not make her move.

The writing is conversational and very direct. Stevenson describes his gear in great detail. He essentially invented the modern sleeping bag for this trip. He called it a "sleeping sack." It was made of green waterproof cloth and lined with blue sheepskin. He carried it on Modestine’s back along with his chocolate, his wine, and his many books.

The book is filled with colorful details about the French countryside. Stevenson writes about sleeping in a pine forest and the "perfect" silence of the night. He uses small paragraphs to capture the sudden bursts of energy and the long stretches of exhaustion. He also dives into the local history. He was walking through the land of the Camisards, who were Protestant rebels who fought a bloody war against the French king.

The real star of the book is the relationship between the man and the donkey. By the end of the twelve-day journey, Stevenson has stopped beating Modestine and has started to love her. When he finally sells her at the end of the trip, he finds himself crying. It is a beautiful and funny story about the reality of the road.
