### **[ The Author: Anna Badkhen (1975–Present) ]**

Anna Badkhen is a journalist who spent years covering wars in places like Afghanistan and Chechnya. She is a woman who knows what violence looks like. But in this book, she turns her attention to something much older. She decided to go to Mali to walk with the Fulani people. These are the world's largest group of nomadic herders. Badkhen is a meticulous observer. She doesn't just watch from a distance. She moves into their world. She eats what they eat and sleeps where they sleep. She writes with a precision that makes the dust feel real on your tongue.

### **[ The Book: *Walking with Abel* ]**

This is a story about the *transhumance*. That is the annual migration of the Fulani and their cattle across the Sahel. Badkhen joins a family led by a patriarch named Abel. They are moving their herd across the savanna in search of water and grass. It is a journey that has been happening for thousands of years.

The writing is direct and incredibly vivid. Badkhen captures the "pulaaku." This is the strict Fulani code of behavior. It is built on stoicism and the ability to hide pain or hunger. She describes the cows as the center of the universe. To the Fulani, a cow is not just property. It is a member of the family. The bond between the herder and the beast is sacred.

She uses small paragraphs to show the daily grind of the trek. She writes about the constant threat of thirst and the way the desert sun can crush a person's spirit. But there is also a dramatic flair in the background. While the family walks, the modern world is closing in. Islamic militants are moving through the region. The climate is changing and making the water holes disappear.

Badkhen shows us a culture that is beautiful and incredibly tough. She doesn't romanticize the poverty. She shows the colorful details of the markets and the quiet dignity of the nomads. It is a haunting book about a way of life that is slowly being erased by the 21st century.
