## IV. Frontiers and Frictions

Some travel writing exists at boundaries—places where language fails, customs clash, or belief systems refuse to align. These are books about misunderstanding, negotiation, and encounter.

Isabella Bird in Meiji Japan, Doughty among the Bedouin, Rory Stewart in post-Taliban Afghanistan—these travelers do not move smoothly through the world. Culture resists them. They are corrected, confused, and often humbled. The friction is the point.

This is the largest category in the collection, and perhaps the most essential. It captures what happens when travel forces the writer to confront difference rather than simply observe it.
