### **[ The Book: *From the Holy Mountain* ]**

Spring 587 AD: Two Greek Orthodox monks, John Moschos and his pupil Sophronius the Sophist, embarked on extraordinary expedition across entire Byzantine world—from Mount Athos to Egypt's sand dunes. They stayed in caves, monasteries, remote hermitages, collecting wisdom of stylites and desert fathers, documenting a fragile Christian civilization already decaying before Islam's emergence. Moschos compiled observations into *The Spiritual Meadow* (Pratum Spirituale), written at Constantinople.

June to December 1994: Dalrymple retraces their footsteps fourteen hundred and seven years later—Mount Athos through eastern Turkey into Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt. Using Moschos's text as guide and inspiration, he creates "an evensong for a dying civilization." The result is his unsurpassed masterpiece: scholarly yet accessible, moving yet unflinching, politically topical yet historically grounded.

The book operates on multiple levels simultaneously. It's historical pilgrimage retracing sixth-century journey. It's elegy for Eastern Christianity's slow extinction in its Middle Eastern birthplace. It's political reportage documenting 1990s realities—Turkish civil war, Beirut ruins, West Bank tensions, Egyptian fundamentalist uprising. It's meditation on religious coexistence and civilization's fragility. It's reminder that Christianity is fundamentally Eastern religion, rooted in Middle Eastern intellectual ferment, not Western invention.

Dalrymple's prose combines lyrical travel writing with meticulous scholarship. At every location, he recalls Moschos and other Byzantine authors, recounts stories about dancers, acrobats, saints, abbots, riots, chattering congregations. He brings lost world to life with rich syncretism of classical, Byzantine, Islamic civilizations. His ear for conversation rivals Alan Bennett's. He finds extraordinary characters: monks maintaining ancient traditions, bishops navigating hostile political landscapes, ordinary believers struggling to preserve flame of faith amid overwhelming pressures.

The journey reveals tragic patterns. Eastern Turkey tells grim story of Armenian and Syriac genocides—once-thriving Christian communities systematically destroyed. Yet Syria and Lebanon offer different narrative: barren Christian women still visit Nebi Uri shrine in Aleppo while Muslim women visit Notre Dame de Seidnaya icon in Damascus—all conceive and bear children. Muslim Syrian cosmonauts sacrifice sheep to Virgin Mary for safe space journey. Druze children attend Catholic/Maronite schools. "There is no clash of civilizations here," Dalrymple concludes. Peaceful coexistence survived centuries better than modern sectarian narratives admit.

Palestine reveals different tragedy. Zionist 1948 seizure expelled nearly 700,000 Palestinians, sizeable portion Christian, dispersed across Middle East and world. Armenian bishop in occupied Jerusalem describes Israeli treatment of Christian community—historic monastery discovered during road construction on expropriated Arab land, his pleas to preserve site ignored, entire complex bulldozed.

Throughout, Dalrymple avoids romanticizing or demonizing. He documents both persecution and tolerance, fanaticism and coexistence, destruction and survival. The book's power lies in allowing voices to speak: elderly monks, displaced refugees, scholars, survivors. He shows how ideology and empire—Ottoman, Zionist, nationalist—have been unkind to Levantine Christian legacy. Yet remnants survive, haunting in their persistence.

Published 1997, won Scottish Arts Council Autumn Book Award, shortlisted Duff Cooper Prize, Thomas Cook Award, John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. Critics ranked it with great modern travel books: Byron's *Road to Oxiana*, Leigh Fermor's *Time of Gifts*, Newby's *Short Walk in the Hindu Kush*. A.S. Byatt praised it. Karen Armstrong called it "elegant, poignant, and courageous account." Peter Levi: "The best and most unexpected book I have read since I forget when."
