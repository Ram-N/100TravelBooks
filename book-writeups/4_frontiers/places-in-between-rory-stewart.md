### **[ The Journey ]**

Rory Stewart did something that most people thought was insane. In early 2002 he decided to walk across Afghanistan. The war was still fresh and the Taliban had only recently fallen. The mountains were deep in snow and the roads were a maze of landmines. He started in Herat and walked all the way to Kabul. He had a walking stick and a very old dog named Babur. He didn't have a plan beyond putting one foot in front of the other.

He spent his nights in freezing village huts. He relied on the ancient code of hospitality. Even people who had almost nothing would share their bread and their tea with him. He writes about the "places in between." These are the tiny spots on the map that the rest of the world ignores. They are places where time seems to have stopped centuries ago.

The book is filled with dramatic details. He describes the biting cold and the exhaustion that settles into your bones. He talks to local warlords and lonely farmers. He visits the Minaret of Jam which is a stunning tower of brick hidden in a deep canyon. He sees the empty niches where the Bamiyan Buddhas were destroyed. He records the layers of history that are baked into the soil.

Stewart is a very patient observer. He doesn't judge the people he meets. He just listens to their stories. He captures the pride and the grit of the Afghan people. By the end of the walk he is a different man. He shows that the best way to understand a country is to walk through it at the speed of a human heart.
