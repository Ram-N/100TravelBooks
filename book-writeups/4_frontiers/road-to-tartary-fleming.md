### **[ The Journey ]**

Peter Fleming was a man of the world. He was a journalist for *The Times* and the brother of the man who gave us James Bond. In 1935 he decided to do something truly reckless. He wanted to travel from Peking to India across the heart of Central Asia. This was a land that was closed to the world and filled with secrets.

He teamed up with a Swiss woman named Ella Maillart. He called her Kini. They were not exactly friends but they were excellent partners. They shared a sense of adventure and a deep dislike of being told no. They set out into a landscape that was tearing itself apart. Between them and their destination lay three thousand miles of dust and drama.

Xinjiang was a mess of civil war and Soviet influence. It was a place where spies were everywhere and borders shifted with the wind. Fleming and Kini didn't have the right permits. They traveled as accidental tourists. They moved by camel and horse through the vast and empty spaces of the Gobi.

They faced bandits and freezing nights and the constant fear of being arrested. Fleming writes about it all with a very British sense of humor. He treats the threat of execution like a missed train. He focuses on the small things. He describes the taste of bad tea and the stubbornness of their animals. He makes the impossible sound like a walk in the park.

They crossed the high mountain passes where the air is thin and the world is white. They reached the end of their trek seven months after they started. They had seen a side of the world that few would ever see again. This is a story about the pure joy of the road and the strength of the human spirit. It is a classic of the golden age of travel.
