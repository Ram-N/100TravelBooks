### **[ The Author: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762) ]**

Lady Mary was a rebel in a corset. She was a brilliant aristocrat and a self-taught scholar who refused to be a quiet wife. When her husband was appointed ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1716 she didn't stay home. She packed her bags and headed for Constantinople. She was a woman of immense wit and a razor-sharp tongue. She was a survivor of smallpox which had scarred her face and killed her brother. This made her a woman on a mission. She wasn't just looking for adventure; she was looking for a way to save lives.

### **[ The Book: *Turkish Embassy Letters* ]**

These letters were never meant for the public but they became a sensation. Lady Mary writes to her friends and family back in England with a colorful and dramatic flair. She describes her journey across Europe and her life in the heart of the Ottoman Empire. She had a unique advantage over every male traveler of her time. Because she was a woman she could enter the "Zenana" or the women’s quarters.

The writing is direct and incredibly observant. She describes the Turkish baths as places of total freedom and beauty. She famously saw the women there as "Grecian goddesses" rather than the oppressed captives that male writers imagined. She uses small paragraphs to break down the complex fashion and the social hierarchies of the court. She writes about the "Turkish habit" of dress and how it gave her a sense of anonymity and power.

The most important part of the book is her discovery of "ingrafting." She watched as Turkish women used a tiny bit of smallpox to create immunity in their children. She was the first European to bring the idea of inoculation back to England. She even had her own son "ingrafted" on the spot. She fought against the skeptical doctors in London with the same ferocity she used to explore a bazaar.

She writes with an honesty that was centuries ahead of its time. She challenges the "Orientalist" stereotypes of the East and shows a culture that was in many ways more advanced and cleaner than her own. It is a book about a woman who used her privilege to bridge two very different worlds.
