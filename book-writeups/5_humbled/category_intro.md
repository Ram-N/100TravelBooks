## V. Humbled by the World

A smaller group of books operates differently. Here, the constraint is not geography or culture, but the traveler's own nature. Eric Newby is unprepared. Bill Bryson is out of shape. Sihle Khumalo dismantles stereotypes through wit and honesty.

These books use humor, but they are not merely comic. They show that travel can teach through awkwardness, failure, and ordinary human limitation. The world resists not because it is extreme or foreign, but because the traveler is flawed.

I struggled with naming this category. "Satirical Resistance" felt wrong—it suggested the books were mocking travel rather than engaging with it seriously. "Humbled by the World" better captures what happens in these journeys: the traveler learns by being brought down to size.
