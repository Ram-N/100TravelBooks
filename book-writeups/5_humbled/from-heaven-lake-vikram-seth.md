### **[ The Deep Dive ]**

Vikram Seth was just a student when he decided to go home. He was finishing a degree in China and realized he could take a plane to Delhi or he could do something far more interesting. He chose the interesting route. He left the dull safety of a university tour and headed into the wild northwest of China.

The journey started in the blistering heat of Turfan. He didn't have much money and he didn't have the right permits. In 1981 China was a maze of red tape and suspicious officials. Seth used his charm and his voice to get through. He literally sang Hindi film songs to win over a local official for a visa stamp. That is the kind of traveler he is. He is someone who finds common ground in a song or a shared cigarette.

The book is a masterpiece of human connection. Seth hitches rides in loud and rattling trucks across the Chaidam Basin. He battles altitude sickness and knee-deep mud in Tibet. He sleeps in cramped truck cabs with drivers who talk in their sleep. Through it all he stays focused on the people. He meets Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists and Han Chinese workers. He sees them as individuals rather than political symbols.

Seth writes with a poet's eye for detail. He describes the intense blue of Heaven Lake and the massive snow capped peaks of the Himalayas. He also dives into the grit of travel. He talks about the hunger and the itching and the constant cold. It is a raw and honest account of a world that was just starting to open up to the West. He leaves the reader with a sense of wonder. You realize that the borders on a map are nothing compared to the warmth of a stranger.
