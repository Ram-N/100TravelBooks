### **[ The Journey ]**

Mark Adams lived his life behind a desk. He spent his days editing stories about brave explorers while he sat in a climate-controlled office in New York. He decided it was time to change that. He wanted to solve a mystery. Was Hiram Bingham a great explorer or just a very lucky looter? Adams decided to retrace Bingham’s 1911 expedition through the Andes.

He did not go alone. He hired John Leivers. John was a legendary Australian guide who lived for the trail. He was the kind of man who could survive on coca leaves and stubbornness. Adams had to trade his leather city shoes for heavy hiking boots. He had to learn how to survive in the thin air of the mountains. The change was not easy. He writes about his struggles with a sharp wit that makes the history feel real.

The book moves between two timelines. We follow Bingham as he hacks through the jungle a century ago. We also follow Adams as he struggles with wet socks and steep climbs today. He visits the ruins of Vitcos and Choquequirao. He looks at the stones and sees the genius of Incan engineering. He also looks at the fight over the artifacts that Bingham took to Yale. He asks who really owns the past.

By the time they reach Machu Picchu the reader feels every mile. Adams describes the clouds parting to reveal the stone city. It is a dramatic moment. He shows that the site is more than just a spot for tourists. It is a masterpiece of a lost civilization. This is a story about the bridge between the past and the present. It is for anyone who has ever wondered what lies over the next ridge.
