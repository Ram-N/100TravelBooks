## VI. Institutional Constraints

By the twentieth century, the world was mapped, but movement was not free. Visas, permits, train schedules, borders, checkpoints—these are the constraints of modern travel. The world resists not through wilderness, but through bureaucracy and infrastructure.

Paul Theroux's railways, Colin Thubron's Silk Road, Jonathan Raban's Inside Passage—these journeys exist within systems. The traveler does not confront the unknown. The traveler navigates what has already been organized, administered, and controlled.
