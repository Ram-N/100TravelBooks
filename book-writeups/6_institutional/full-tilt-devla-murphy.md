### **[ The Author: Dervla Murphy (1931–2022) ]**

Born November 28, 1931, in Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland, she received her lifetime's ambition on her tenth birthday: a secondhand bicycle and a secondhand atlas. Halfway up a hill near Lismore, she looked down at her legs pushing the pedals and thought: if I kept doing this long enough, I could reach India. Then her mother contracted severe rheumatoid arthritis. At fourteen, Murphy left the Ursuline Convent boarding school to become her mother's caregiver. For sixteen years she remained tethered to Lismore—"extremely resentful, especially through my twenties," though never resentful of her mother, only of fate. When her mother died in 1962, Murphy was thirty-one, unmarried, unfamous, holding a house full of books and unshakeable convictions about political injustice. She stripped her Armstrong Cadet bicycle down to a single speed (three-speed derailleurs seemed too delicate for the Middle East), named it Roz after Don Quixote's Rozinante, purchased a .25 pistol and rudimentary training from County Waterford police, mailed spare inner tubes to British and Irish embassies along her route, got vaccinated for yellow fever in case she returned via Africa, and pedaled away. *Full Tilt* became the first of over twenty travel books spanning five decades—Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Peru, Baltistan, Cameroon, Romania, Laos, Yugoslavia during the Balkans conflicts, Gaza and the West Bank, Northern Ireland during the Troubles. She never learned to drive. She traveled alone, without luxuries, depending on local hospitality. She later traveled with her daughter Rachel, born 1968 (conceived deliberately without marriage), sometimes mistaken for Rachel's husband until she unbuttoned her shirt. She lived in Lismore until her death at ninety, swimming naked in the River Blackwater, writing longhand, heating nothing except when guests visited because cold didn't bother her.

### **[ The Book: *Full Tilt* ]**

The journey began January 1963 and covered approximately 3,000 miles over six months—Ireland to France to Yugoslavia to Bulgaria to Turkey to Iran to Afghanistan to Pakistan to Delhi. Murphy departed during one of Europe's worst winters in seventy years. She writes dismissively about crossing France and Italy through ice and snowdrifts: boring. The real journey begins in Yugoslavia, where she switches from letters to keeping a daily diary, which becomes the book's foundation. She resists adding encyclopedic facts later, preferring raw observation recorded each evening.

The prose is straightforward, unpretentious, occasionally wry. Murphy describes dangers with peculiar equanimity. She doesn't fear the possibility of danger, only the actuality. In Bulgaria, wolves surround her at night—three pistol shots: one wounded, one killed. In Iran, thieves approach; she fires the gun to frighten them. At a police station, she escapes an attempted rapist using what she calls unprintable tactics. In Afghanistan, traveling by bus through mountain passes during a lightning storm, she cannot see the two recently crashed buses lying in the ravine below. A heated argument breaks out among passengers about the fare. In the chaos, a rifle butt strikes her, fracturing three ribs. She rests overnight in what she describes as a Grade A luxury tourist hotel—hardly any fleas, real glass in several windows. At dawn, she looks across the valley toward the cave monastery and the sixth-century Bamiyan Buddha, fifty-five meters high, carved in place from sandstone (destroyed by Taliban artillery in 2001).

Afghanistan affects her profoundly. She calls herself "Afghanatical" and writes that "the Afghan is a man after my own heart." The book captures pre-war Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan—places now inaccessible or irrevocably changed. Murphy's genius lies in her immediate rapport with ordinary people. She enjoys mutton soup that is twenty-five percent grease with lumps of fat floating in it. She accepts hardship with such insouciance that readers barely register she's traveling on a £64 budget, sleeping in primitive accommodations, enduring blizzards, floods, heat exhaustion, stomach disorders, and constant physical strain.

The manuscript reached John Murray publishers on the suggestion of Penelope Betjeman, whom Murphy met in Delhi. Initially too modest to contact such an illustrious publisher, she sent it anyway. Published 1965, it established her as Ireland's foremost female travel writer and became a historical document of a vanished world.

* **The Soundtrack:** The sound of a single-speed bicycle clicking steadily uphill, and silence punctuated by wolves howling in Bulgarian darkness.
