### **[ The Journey ]**

In 1973, Paul Theroux walked out of his house in London and headed for the station. He did not just want to see Asia. He wanted to live on its rails. He spent four months looping across the world on legendary trains. He rode the Orient Express and the Frontier Mail. He ended his epic loop on the frozen tracks of the Trans-Siberian Express.

Theroux is not your typical happy-go-lucky traveler. He is famously grumpy and incredibly observant. He stays on the move to avoid the boredom of his own mind. He finds drama in the cramped cabins and the dining cars. He talks to everyone from hippies to diplomats. He records their strange stories with a wit that is often biting and always honest.

The book is a time capsule of a lost world. He passes through Afghanistan before the wars began. He sees Vietnam as the conflict there was still raw. He captures the grit of the Indian railway system. He describes the scent of coal smoke and the taste of tepid beer. It is a sensory explosion.

This journey is as much about the passengers as the scenery. Theroux believes that a train contains the soul of a nation. He shows us that the best part of travel is the friction of meeting strangers. By the time he returns to London, he is exhausted but transformed. This book changed travel writing forever. It made the journey itself more important than the destination.
