### **[ The Author: Redmond O’Hanlon (b. 1947) ]**

Redmond O’Hanlon is an Oxford-educated literary scholar who decided that the best way to understand the Victorian explorers was to go out and suffer just as they did. He is a man of massive intellect and even larger eccentricities. O’Hanlon doesn't just travel; he collapses into the "blank spots" of the map with exuberant clumsiness. He is a serious naturalist with a gift for slapstick, a man who can identify a rare kingfisher while being bitten by a dozen insects he hasn't yet named. He represents the late 20th-century peak of British travel writing: scientifically rigorous, deeply well-read, and hilariously self-deprecating.

### **[ The Book: *Into the Heart of Borneo* ]**

First published in 1984, this is the story of O’Hanlon and his friend, the poet James Fenton, as they attempt to retrace a 1926 expedition to the remote Mount Batu Tiban. Their goal was to find the elusive Bornean rhinoceros, but the journey became a legendary test of amateur endurance.

The writing is direct, vibrant, and incredibly funny. O’Hanlon avoids the "noble explorer" trope entirely. He uses small paragraphs to capture the sensory overload of the jungle—the oppressive heat, the "sodden kit," and the relentless swarms of leeches. He has a dramatic flair for the absurdity of two Englishmen depending on three Iban guides to keep them alive while they argue about poetry and birds.

He provides colorful detail about the Iban people. He writes about longhouse hospitality, the potent effects of *tuak* (rice wine), and the lingering echoes of head-hunting history with genuine respect and zero romanticism.

Amidst the jokes about his own discomfort, O’Hanlon offers precise observations on the flora and fauna of a rainforest already threatened by logging. It is a story of a man who found that the "heart of darkness" was actually full of light, laughter, and an overwhelming amount of life.

### **[ The Signature Line ]**

> "The jungle is a place where every inch of the world around you crawls, slithers, bites, or drips—and yet, despite the misery, you find yourself exhilarated."
