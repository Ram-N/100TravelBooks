## VII. Inhabited Landscapes

Some travel writing takes place in densely human worlds—cities, islands, provinces—where the complexity is social rather than geographic. Jan Morris in Venice, Peter Hessler in a Yangtze River town, Suketu Mehta in Mumbai.

These books are not about endurance or discovery. They are about learning to see a place where millions of lives are already unfolding. The constraint is the overwhelming density of human experience. The traveler must find a way to navigate not wilderness, but society.
