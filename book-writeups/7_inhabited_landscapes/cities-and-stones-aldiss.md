### **[ The Author: Brian Aldiss (1925–2017) ]**

Brian Aldiss is world-famous as a titan of Science Fiction, the man who wrote the story that became the film *A.I. Artificial Intelligence*. But he was also a masterful travel writer with a deeply poetic sensibility. In the mid-1960s, he took his family on a long, slow drive through the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Aldiss didn't look at the world like a scientist; he looked at it like a dreamer and a historian. He had a sharp eye for the "stones"—the ruins, the churches, and the fortresses—that stood as silent witnesses to the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman ghosts of the Balkans.

### **[ The Book: *Cities and Stones* ]**

Published in 1966, this book is a vivid snapshot of a country that was then the "maverick" of the Eastern Bloc. While much of the world saw Yugoslavia as a monolithic Communist state, Aldiss saw a chaotic, beautiful, and deeply divided collection of cultures.

The writing is direct and incredibly scannable. Aldiss avoids the dry tone of a guidebook, opting instead for a conversational style filled with dramatic flair. He uses small paragraphs to describe the startling contrast between the sleek, modern hotels being built for tourists and the ancient, crumbling villages of the interior. He is particularly obsessed with the light of the Adriatic and the "brutal" honesty of the Balkan landscape.

He provides colorful detail about the daily life under Tito’s rule—the crowded buses, the smell of roasting meat, and the guarded conversations with locals. He writes about the "stones" of the title with a sense of awe, particularly in places like Split, where people lived inside the walls of a Roman emperor’s palace. He captures the tension of a country trying to forge a new identity while literally living among the debris of its past. It is a story of a traveler looking for the "eternal" elements of a place that was rapidly changing.
