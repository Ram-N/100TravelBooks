### **[ The Author: Colin McPhee (1900–1964) ]**

Colin McPhee was a Canadian composer who was living the high life in New York. Then he heard a recording of Balinese gamelan music. It changed his life instantly. He described it as the most beautiful sound he had ever heard. He packed his bags and moved to the other side of the world. He was not just a tourist. He was a serious scholar. He spent years documenting a musical tradition that was at risk of disappearing. He was a man of great sensitivity and a bit of a romantic. He wanted to preserve beauty in a bottle.

### **[ The Book: *A House in Bali* ]**

This is widely considered one of the best books ever written about Bali. It captures the island in the 1930s before the jet planes and the influencers arrived. McPhee arrives with his wife and decides to build a house in the village of Sayan. He doesn't just hire a contractor. He gets involved in every detail of the construction. He learns the complex spiritual rules of Balinese architecture. He creates a home that is open to the jungle and the spirits.

The heart of the book is the music. McPhee is obsessed with the "gamelan." These are the bronze orchestras that play the shimmering, percussive music of the island. He finds that many of the old orchestras have sold their instruments to pay for taxes or cockfights. He decides to start his own. He gathers a group of local children and hires a master teacher. He watches them transform from rowdy kids into disciplined artists.

The writing is lush and atmospheric. McPhee describes the sound of the gongs echoing through the rice terraces at night. He writes about the dancers with a dramatic flair. He focuses on a young dancer named Sampih whom he treats almost like a son. He captures the magic of the festivals and the shadow puppet plays.

But there is a sadness here too. McPhee knows that the modern world is coming. He sees the Dutch colonial government tightening its grip. He sees the cheap goods flooding the markets. He writes with a sense of urgency. He wants to write it all down before the silence takes over. It is a beautiful and melancholy look at a golden age that is gone forever.
