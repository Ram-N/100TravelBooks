### **[ The Author: Arthur Grimble (1888–1956) ]**

Arthur Grimble was a young man of the British Empire who arrived in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1914. He was a "cadet officer." This meant he was at the very bottom of the colonial ladder. He was skinny and nervous and he had a very high opinion of himself that the islands quickly knocked out of him. He eventually became the Resident Commissioner but he is remembered best for his deep love of Gilbertese culture. He didn't just rule. He listened. He learned the language and the ancient myths and he wrote about them with a wit that is still funny today.

### **[ The Book: *A Pattern of Islands* ]**

This book is a collection of memories from his first six years in the Pacific. It is famous for being incredibly self-deprecating. Grimble isn't the hero of his own story. He is usually the victim of his own ignorance. He tells stories of his struggle to maintain British dignity while living in a place where the local people were far more capable than he was.

The writing is conversational and very direct. He describes the islands as "low-lying strips of coral sand" that felt like the very edge of the world. He uses small paragraphs to relay the most dramatic moments of his life. One of the most famous scenes involves him being used as human bait for tiger sharks. He had to jump into the water so the local hunters could grab the shark when it turned to bite him. He also writes about a terrifying duel with a giant octopus in a dark sea cave.

The book is filled with colorful details about Gilbertese life. He writes about the "maneaba" or the community meeting house where all the real power resided. He explains the complex rules of hospitality and the beautiful, haunting poetry of the islanders. He captures the transition from the old world of spirits and curses to the new world of British law.

This is a book about a man who realized that he was the "savage" and the people he was supposed to "civilize" were actually the ones with the superior culture. It is a warm and funny portrait of a lost era in the Pacific.
