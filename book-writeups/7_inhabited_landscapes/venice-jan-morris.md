### **[ The Author: Jan Morris (1926–2020) ]**

Born James Humphry Morris in Clevedon, Somerset, Jan Morris first encountered Venice in 1945 as an 18-year-old British Army intelligence officer—then James, a man to the world, a woman to herself. The city was intoxicating, the beginning of a lifelong obsession. By the time she returned in 1959 with her family to write *Venice*, Morris was already an accomplished journalist who had broken the story of Edmund Hillary's Everest summit for *The Times* in 1953. She spent months living in the city, running about "like a mad dog," as she put it—law courts, markets, railway stations—with her own small boat for exploring the lagoon's remoter reaches. The book, published in 1960 under the name James Morris, won the Heinemann Award and became an international bestseller. In 1972, Morris transitioned, traveling to Morocco for surgery because British doctors demanded she divorce her wife Elizabeth first—something she refused to do. Her memoir *Conundrum* (1974) became one of the first autobiographical accounts of gender transition. Morris revised *Venice* four times over six decades, the text evolving as she did. She spent her final years in North Wales with Elizabeth, whom she married, divorced, and re-partnered with over their 70 years together. Morris wrote over 50 books—the *Pax Britannica* trilogy on the British Empire, portraits of Oxford, Trieste, Hong Kong, Manhattan, Sydney—but *Venice* remained the purest distillation of her gift: seeing places as living beings with souls.

### **[ The Book: *Venice* ]**

This is not a guidebook. This is not a history. This is, as Morris herself declares, "a highly subjective, romantic, impressionistic picture less of a city than of an experience." Divided into three sections—The People, The City, The Lagoon—it approaches Venice as organism, Venice as architecture, Venice as aquatic dream. Morris uses history "magpie-style," embedding glittering fragments where they shine most brightly rather than arranging them chronologically. The result reads like a love letter composed by someone who knows love requires honesty.

The prose is baroque, euphoric, occasionally melancholic—sentences that tumble and pirouette like gondolas navigating narrow canals. Morris describes the fish market as "a glorious, wet, colourful, high-smelling concourse of the sea" where stalls are "lined deliciously with green fronds" bearing "a delicately-tinted, slobbering, writhing, glistening mass" of sea-creatures. She captures the "soft fastidious splash of oars" at dawn, the city waking reluctantly in February fog, the way snow makes Venice seem dressed in "improper whimsy, as if you were to dress a duchess in pink ruffles." The city crawls with lions—winged lions, pretty lions, lions on doorways and corbels, "self-satisfied lions in gardens."

But Morris never sentimentalizes. She acknowledges the tourists, the decay, the absurdities. Venice is "cheek-by-jowl, back-of-the-hand, under-the-counter, higgledy-piggledy" and "rich in piquant wrinkled things, like an assortment of bric-a-brac in the house of a wayward connoisseur." She recognizes that tourism is part of the Venetian mystique, that the Piazza is "better, livelier, lovelier for its garish summer crowds." The book captures a specific historical moment—Morris writing as young James in 1959—but the city's essential strangeness transcends time. What makes *Venice* endure is its understanding that places, like people, contain contradictions. The city is simultaneously dying and eternal, vulgar and sublime, a tourist trap and a genuine wonder. Morris simply trusts you to handle the complexity.

### **[ Destinations Explored ]**

* **The Lagoon:** The shallow, ever-shifting waters that birthed Venice—where the tides cleanse the canals and migrant settlers built churches on islets of silt beginning in the 5th century.
* **San Marco:** The heart of Venetian power, where the Basilica's Byzantine domes glitter and the Campanile's golden angel raises "his golden forefinger" in what Morris calls "an exhortatory, almost an ecological pose."
* **The Fish Market:** Beside the Grand Canal, where dawn barges deliver the day's sea-creatures to stalls "lined deliciously with green fronds."
* **Santa Margherita:** An unsophisticated square where no socialites pose, no film stars cross their legs revealingly—just the genuine temper of Venice, best experienced with cheap Veneto wine.
* **The Islands:** Murano's glass-blowers, Burano's lace-makers, Torcello's haunting emptiness—the scattered archipelago that defines the lagoon's character.

### **[ The Signature Line ]**

> "Venice is a cheek-by-jowl, back-of-the-hand, under-the-counter, higgledy-piggledy, anecdotal city, and she is rich in piquant wrinkled things, like an assortment of bric-a-brac in the house of a wayward connoisseur, or parasites on an oyster-shell."

### **[ The Perfect Pairing ]**

* **The Drink:** Prosecco at a café in Campo Santa Margherita, watching the particular world go by.
* **The Soundtrack:** Church bells at irregular intervals, the splash of oars on water, the cries of vendors—Venice makes its own music.
* **The Setting:** A palazzo bedroom in the half-light of dawn, windows open to the lagoon, when you can hear the soft fastidious splash of oars and pretend, briefly, that you live here.
