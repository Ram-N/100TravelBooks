### **[ The Journey ]**

Peter Mayle and his wife did what many people only dream about. They bought an old stone farmhouse in the Luberon region of France. They moved in on New Year’s Day. The Mistral wind greeted them with a freezing blast. It was a cold start to a new life. This was not the sunny paradise from the postcards yet. They had to learn the rules of a world made of stone and soil.

The book follows the calendar year month by month. Each chapter brings a new struggle or a new feast. There are builders who arrive late and never seem to leave. There are neighbors who hunt for truffles like they are searching for buried gold. The drama is found in the small things. It is in the heat of the summer and the stubbornness of the local plumbing.

Food is the true hero of this story. Mayle describes meals that last for hours. He writes about goat cheese and crusty bread and liters of local wine. He captures the charm of the Provencal people. They are suspicious of outsiders but very loyal to their traditions. They take their lunch breaks seriously and their gossip even more so.

This book started a global obsession with Provence. It made thousands of people want to quit their jobs and buy a ruin in the sun. It is a love letter to a place that refuses to rush for anyone. Mayle shows that the best way to travel is to stay put. You just have to sit back and watch the seasons change.
