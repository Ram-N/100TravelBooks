### **[ The Author: Edward Hoagland (1932–Present) ]**

Edward Hoagland is often called the "poet of the wild." He is a master of the American essay, known for his stutter—which he says made him a better listener—and his deep, unsentimental love for nature. In the late 1970s, he left his home in the Northeast to wander through Sudan. He wasn't there for a specific news story or a political agenda. He went to see how humans and animals were surviving in one of the most remote and fractured places on earth. He writes with a slow, deliberate pace. He notices the things other reporters miss because they are in too much of a hurry.

### **[ The Book: *African Calliope: A Journey to the Sudan* ]**

This book is a tapestry of a country that was, at the time, the largest in Africa. The title refers to the "calliope"—a musical instrument made of steam whistles. For Hoagland, Sudan was a cacophony of different cultures, languages, and conflicts all screaming at once.

The writing is direct but layered with colorful detail. Hoagland uses small paragraphs to capture the heat and the dust of Khartoum and the lush, swampy chaos of the Sudd in the south. He has a dramatic flair for describing the resilience of the people. He writes about the "Invisible Civil War" that was already tearing the country apart. He saw the deep rift between the Arab-dominated North and the Black African South long before it became a permanent feature of world news.

He spends time with everyone: Belgian doctors, Greek traders, Dinka herders, and nervous government officials. He describes the wildlife with the eye of a naturalist, noting how the elephants and lions were being squeezed out by human hunger and war. He doesn't offer easy solutions. He just shows you the beauty and the cruelty of the place. It is a book about a man trying to find the pulse of a nation that was beating with a very irregular rhythm.
