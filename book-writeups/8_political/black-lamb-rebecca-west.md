### **[ The Author: Rebecca West (1892–1983) ]**

Rebecca West was a force of nature. She was a journalist and a critic and a novelist who didn't care for anyone's permission. She was famous for her sharp wit and her even sharper politics. She had a long and complicated affair with H.G. Wells and she raised a son on her own when that was a scandal. West went to Yugoslavia in the late 1930s because she saw the shadow of the Nazis falling over Europe. She wanted to see what was about to be lost. She was a woman who could see a whole civilization in the way a peasant held a loaf of bread.

### **[ The Book: *Black Lamb and Grey Falcon* ]**

This is a monster of a book. It is over a thousand pages long. West takes us on a journey through a country that no longer exists on any map. She travels with her husband through the mountains and cities of Yugoslavia in 1937. The world was on the brink of war. She knew that the people she met and the buildings she saw might soon be dust.

She digs into the blood-soaked history of the Balkans. She looks at the ghosts of the Ottoman and Habsburg empires. She tells the story of kings and rebels with a dramatic flair. She is not just looking at scenery. She is looking for the soul of the people.

The title comes from two vivid and dark images. The "Black Lamb" is a ritual sacrifice she saw in Macedonia. It represents the way people offer up the innocent to satisfy their gods or their politics. The "Grey Falcon" comes from a Serbian folk song about a king who chooses a heavenly kingdom over an earthly one. To West these stories explain why the Balkans are a place of such intense beauty and such terrible tragedy.

She writes about the white stone cities of the coast and the dark forests of the interior. She describes the food and the wine and the endless talk of history. She makes the complex politics of the region feel like a family feud that has lasted for centuries. Her voice is powerful and direct. She does not hide her biases. She loves the Serbs and she has no time for the Austrians. It is a deeply personal book about the high price of being human in a world that loves to fight.
