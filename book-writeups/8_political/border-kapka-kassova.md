### **[ The Author: Kapka Kassabova (1973–Present) ]**

Kapka Kassabova was born in Sofia, Bulgaria. She grew up under the heavy hand of Communism. When the Berlin Wall fell she moved to New Zealand with her family and she later settled in the Highlands of Scotland. She is a poet and a novelist who writes with a haunting and lyrical intensity. She returned to the Balkans to face the landscape of her childhood. She has a rare ability to talk to strangers and extract their deepest and darkest secrets.

### **[ The Book: *Border* ]**

Kapka Kassabova returns to the "triple border" where Bulgaria and Turkey and Greece all meet. This was once the most militarized edge of the Iron Curtain. It was a place where people died trying to escape to the West. Today it is a land of abandoned villages and thick forests and people who live between two worlds.

The book is a collection of encounters. She meets treasure hunters who dig for Roman gold. She talks to former border guards who are still haunted by the people they shot decades ago. She meets refugees from Syria who are trying to cross the same mountains that the locals once fled. She shows that the border is not just a line on a map. It is a state of mind.

The writing is atmospheric and full of a dark magic. She describes the Strandja mountains as a place where the air is thick with myth. She writes about the "fire-dancers" who walk on hot coals in a trance. She uses small paragraphs to build a sense of tension and mystery. She makes the landscape feel like a living character that remembers everything.

She does not just focus on politics. She looks at the human soul. She finds people who have been broken by history and people who have survived it with their humor intact. She has a dramatic flair for the tragic. She tells the story of a German couple who tried to cross the border in the 70s and disappeared into the woods forever. It is a book about the walls we build between each other and the ways we try to tear them down.
