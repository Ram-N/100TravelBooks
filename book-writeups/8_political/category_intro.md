## VIII. Political, Moral, and Historical Reckonings

Then there are journeys where history and power dominate every mile. Rebecca West in the Balkans on the eve of war. Norman Lewis in occupied Naples. Kapka Kassabova on Cold War borders. Tim Butcher following the Congo River through collapse.

In these books, travel is a form of witness. The writer moves through places where violence, ideology, and unresolved history press inescapably on the present. The constraint is not physical or bureaucratic—it is moral. The traveler must reckon with what the journey reveals about power and its consequences.
