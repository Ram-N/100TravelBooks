# The Shadow of the Sun

### *My African Life*

**"The continent is too large to describe. It is a veritable ocean, a separate planet, a varied, immensely rich cosmos. Only with the greatest simplification, for the sake of convenience, can we say 'Africa.' In reality, except as a geographical term, Africa doesn't exist."** — *Ryszard Kapuściński*

### **[ The Author: Ryszard Kapuściński (1932-2007) ]**

Born March 4, 1932, Pinsk, Polesie Voivodeship (now Belarus), eastern borderlands of Second Polish Republic. Son of Maria Bobka (b. 1910) and Józef Kapuściński (b. 1903), both primary school teachers. Sister Barbara born 1933. Born into poverty—would later say he "felt at home in Africa as food was scarce there too and everyone was also barefoot." Multicultural childhood among Jews, Poles, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Romani—credited Pinsk diversity with developing empathy essential to understanding distant cultures. September 1939: family returned to Pinsk after Red Army capture. 1940: mother Maria, fearing deportation, fled with children to Sieraków near Warsaw, reunited with Józef, later moved near Otwock. Family settled Warsaw 1945. Educated Stanisław Staszic Gymnasium. Amateur boxer (bantamweight), footballer. 1948: joined Communist youth organization ZMP. Debuted as poet age 17 in Dziś i jutro (compared to Mayakovsky and Wierzyński). University of Warsaw M.A. 1952. Married Alicja Mielczarek (pediatrician) October 6, 1952; daughter Zofia. Journalist Sztandar Mlodych (Banner of Youth) 1951-58, Polityka 1959-61. 1957: first assignment to Africa witnessing decolonization. 1962: Polish Press Agency's only African correspondent. 1962-1972: foreign correspondent Africa, Asia, Latin America. Between 1956 and 1981 reported 27 revolutions and coups. Survived four death sentences, jailed forty times, contracted tuberculosis, cerebral malaria, blood poisoning, nearly set ablaze with benzene. 1969: witnessed Honduras war (*The Soccer War*). Edited/translated Che Guevara's *El diario del Che en Bolivia*. Deputy editor-in-chief Kultura magazine 1974-81. 1981: fired for supporting pro-democracy Solidarity movement. Freelance writer thereafter. Major works: *The Emperor* (1978, on Haile Selassie), *Shah of Shahs* (1982, Iranian Revolution), *Imperium* (1993, collapsing Soviet Union), *Heban*/*The Shadow of the Sun* (1998/2001). Books translated into 30 languages. Won numerous awards. Considered Nobel Prize candidate. Died January 23, 2007, Warsaw, age 74. Called "Maestro" by Gabriel García Márquez, Tiziano Terzani, Luis Sepúlveda. Posthumous revelation (2010 Artur Domosławski biography): worked for Polish Communist intelligence service while traveling. Also claimed to witness events he hadn't attended (Che Guevara meeting, 1968 Mexico massacre, Congo firing squad reprieve fabricated). Allegations sparked fierce debate about line between literary reportage and journalism—supporters argued Communist censorship necessitated protective fictions; detractors questioned factual accuracy. Style termed "magic journalism" or "literary reportage"—novelist's eye prevailed over journalist's.

### **[ The Book: *The Shadow of the Sun* ]**

Polish title *Heban* (literally "Ebony"). Published Poland 1998 by Czytelnik. English translation by Klara Glowczewska, Alfred A. Knopf 2001. Collection of journalistic accounts and essays spanning nearly forty years reporting Africa, late 1950s to mid-1990s. Not chronological narrative but mosaic—prose flows freely through decades, across boundaries of place and culture. Begins Ghana's independence mid-1950s, ends dark Christmas Eve 1990s when wild elephant disrupts outdoor party.

Opens Dar es Salaam 1962: Kapuściński hears Uganda about to gain independence. What follows is kaleidoscopic portrait of continent in transformation—decolonization's giddy optimism disintegrating into corruption, poverty, violence. He hitchhikes with caravans, wanders Sahara with nomads, lives poverty-stricken Lagos slums, wrestles king cobra to death, suffers malaria. Stayed with ministers and peasants in rural villages—unorthodox access providing "honest perspective."

The book is wrenching, poignant, unfathomably sad yet also celebration of joy and resilience. Heat dominates as character and metaphor—"Dawn and dusk are the most pleasant hours in Africa. The sun is either not yet scorching, or it is no longer so—it lets you be, lets you live." Heat so intense minds retreat into stupor. He describes roaches size of small turtles, lions and elephants (only old, slow ones eat humans), myriads of plants and insects without names. Woman cries in street: someone stole her only possession, a bowl. Violence so barbarous as to make one "ashamed of humanity."

Teaches African conception of time: "Time appears as a result of our actions, and vanishes when we neglect or ignore it." Visits central Ethiopia's eleven medieval churches built below ground level. Provides lyrical descriptions of mountains, plains, wilderness. His Rwanda chapter—"clear, unbearable in intensity"—called "small masterpiece" (Kirkus). The book doesn't present Africa as group of nations or geographic locations but as "vibrant and frequently joyous montage of peoples, cultures, and encounters." Countries visited include Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Liberia.

New York Times praised "penetrating intelligence" and "crystallized descriptive writing...marvel of humane, sorrowful and lucid observation." Wall Street Journal: "Highly detailed, heartfelt, but unsentimental introduction to Africa's afflictions and a quiet love song to its profound appeal." Washington Post: "Great strengths are his style—candid, understated and slightly absurdist, veering into abrupt flights of lyricism on unexpected subjects—and his gift for picking out stories that condense volumes of information into single perfectly crafted passage."

Controversy: Critics noted factual inaccuracies and interpretive oddities. Economist (2001): "Creates an Africa of his own. It is a fascinating place, whether it ever existed as he tells it is another matter altogether." Anthropologist John Ryle's 2001 TLS review accused book of lacking original sources, missing World Bank/IMF influence, containing misinformation (Ethiopia chapter). Aleksandar Hemon (Village Voice) accused racism. David Rieff (LA Times) extended criticism. Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina's essay "How to Write About Africa" indirectly critiques Kapuściński's approach. Defenders argued stylistic accomplishments transcended errors, that Communist reportage tradition necessitated protective fictionalizations, that book should be read as literature not strict journalism.
