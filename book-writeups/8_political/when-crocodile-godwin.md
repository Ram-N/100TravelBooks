### **[ The Author: Peter Godwin (1957–Present) ]**

Peter Godwin was born and raised in what was then Rhodesia. He is a man with a foot in two worlds. He was a human rights lawyer and a journalist who covered wars all over the globe, but his heart never left Africa. He writes with the clinical eye of a reporter and the breaking heart of a son. He is famous for his ability to weave the massive, crushing politics of a failing state into the intimate, quiet moments of his parents’ lives.

### **[ The Book: *When a Crocodile Eats the Sun* ]**

The title refers to a solar eclipse, which in local legend is a dark omen for the land. The book is a sequel to his childhood memoir, *Mukiwa*. It picks up as Zimbabwe begins its terrifying spiral under Robert Mugabe. Godwin returns home from New York to find his elderly parents living in a country that is literally disappearing around them. Their savings are wiped out by hyperinflation. Their friends are being driven off their farms. The rule of law has been replaced by the rule of the mob.

The writing is direct and very moving. Godwin describes the "green and pleasant land" of his youth turning into a place of hunger and fear. He uses small paragraphs to capture the absurdity of life in a collapsing state. He tells stories of people carrying mountains of cash just to buy a loaf of bread. He writes about the violence in the countryside with a dramatic flair that never feels cheap. It is a portrait of a slow-motion disaster.

But the real shock of the book is a family secret. As his father’s health fails, Godwin discovers that the man he thought was a British colonial official was actually a Polish Jew who fled the Holocaust. His father had spent his whole life hiding his identity to fit into the white society of Africa. Now, as the white Africans are being cast out, the irony is overwhelming.

This is a book about what it means to belong. It asks if you can truly call a place home when the ground is being pulled from under your feet. Godwin doesn’t just show us the politics; he shows us the courage of his parents as they refuse to leave the only life they know. It is a haunting and beautiful story about the end of an era.
