### **[ The Author: John Gimlette (1963–Present) ]**

John Gimlette is a British barrister and a writer with a taste for the obscure. He doesn't go where the tourists go. He goes to the places that have been abandoned by history. He is a master of the "long-form" travel book—combining deep historical research with sharp, present-day reporting. He has a dry, understated wit and a lawyer’s eye for the bizarre. He is not easily shocked. Whether he is talking to a former guerrilla fighter or a jungle gold miner, he listens with a calm and curious focus.

### **[ The Book: *Wild Coast* ]**

This book is a journey through the "Three Guianas": Guyana (formerly British), Suriname (formerly Dutch), and French Guiana. This is a region of South America that most people can't find on a map. It is a land of incredible biodiversity and a terrifyingly violent past.

The writing is direct and packed with colorful details. Gimlette describes the landscape as a "wall of green" that has swallowed up cities and plantations. He uses small paragraphs to dive into the dramatic history of the region—the brutal slave rebellions, the Jonestown massacre, and the infamous "Devil’s Island" penal colony. He has a flair for describing the eccentric characters he meets, from the descendants of escaped slaves to European scientists hunting for new species of ants.

Gimlette doesn't sugarcoat the reality. He writes about the corruption and the decay, but he also captures the strange, haunted beauty of the place. He travels by dugout canoe and bush plane into the deep interior where the rivers are the only roads. He shows us a world where the forest is always reclaiming the land. It is a story about the resilience of nature and the madness of the humans who tried to tame it.
