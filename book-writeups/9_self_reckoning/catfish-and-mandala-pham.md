### **[ The Author: Andrew X. Pham (1967–Present) ]**

Andrew Pham is a man caught in the "in-between." He was born in Vietnam but fled with his family as a "boat person" after the fall of Saigon. He grew up in California and became a successful engineer. But he was haunted. After his transgender sister committed suicide, his world collapsed. He quit his job and sold his possessions. He decided to find himself by pedaling a bicycle across the land he had fled as a child. He writes with a raw, bleeding honesty. He doesn't just observe the world; he feels it through the scars on his own skin.

### **[ The Book: *Catfish and Mandala* ]**

This is a story of two journeys running parallel. One is the physical grit of a year-long bicycle trip through the Pacific Rim and into Vietnam. The other is the story of his family’s harrowing escape from the Viet Cong.

The writing is electric and deeply conversational. Pham uses small paragraphs to capture the sensory overload of modern Vietnam. He describes the "chaos of the mopeds" and the smell of fish sauce and diesel. He has a dramatic flair for the painful moments. He writes about being treated as a "Viet Kieu" (Overseas Vietnamese). To the locals he is a rich American. To the Americans he is an outsider. He belongs nowhere.

The book is called a "Mandala" because it circles back on itself. He weaves in the history of the war and the brutal reality of the re-education camps his father survived. He eats "everything that moves" and sleeps in cheap guesthouses. He battles heat and illness and the ghosts of his family. He looks for the "catfish" of his youth—the simple, muddy reality of home.

It is a story about the search for a home that might not exist anymore. It is about forgiving your parents and yourself. Pham shows us that you can’t truly move forward until you have pedaled back through the mud of your own history.
