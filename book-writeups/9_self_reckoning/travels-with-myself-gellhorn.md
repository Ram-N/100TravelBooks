### **[ The Author: Martha Gellhorn (1908–1998) ]**

Martha Gellhorn was a legendary war correspondent who covered almost every major conflict of the 20th century. She was famously married to Ernest Hemingway but she hated being defined by him. She was a woman of fierce independence and a sharp tongue. She traveled the world not for luxury but to see the truth. She lived a long and restless life and she never lost her appetite for a good story or a stiff drink. She was one of the first women to land at Normandy on D-Day and her bravery was as famous as her writing.

### **[ The Book: *Travels with Myself and Another* ]**

Martha Gellhorn did not write about sunsets and five-star hotels. She wrote about the sweat and the dirt and the bad food. This book is a collection of five trips that went wrong in the most spectacular ways. She calls them her "journeys from hell." She travels with a companion she calls "U.C." or the Unwilling Companion. Most readers know this was Ernest Hemingway. They head to China in 1941 to see the war with Japan. It is a nightmare of mud and mosquitoes and endless official dinners.

The writing is blunt and very funny. She does not hide her misery. She describes the physical pain of a long trek through the Caribbean in a tiny boat. She looks for German submarines and finds only boredom and sunstroke. She goes to Africa and tries to cross from Chad to the Sudan. She ends up in a landscape that is both beautiful and terrifying. She meets people who are living on the edge of survival. She is not a tourist who wants to be entertained. She is a witness who wants to understand.

Gellhorn is a master of the colorful detail. She describes the smell of a crowded bus or the taste of a warm beer in the desert. She has a dramatic flair for the ridiculous. She shows that travel is often a series of small disasters that we only enjoy once they are over. She is a woman who refuses to be a victim of her surroundings. She mocks the pompous and the lazy with equal vigor. Her relationship with Hemingway adds a layer of sharp tension. They bicker in the rain and argue in the mud. It is a domestic drama played out on a global stage.

Her trip to Russia is a study in frustration. She tries to find the heart of the Soviet Union but finds only red tape. She ends her book in Israel where she looks for a moment of peace. The book is a celebration of the human spirit. It shows that even when everything goes wrong we can still find something to write home about. It is a perfect antidote to the typical glossy travel guide. She reminds us that the best stories come from the worst days. Her voice is a tonic for anyone who has ever felt out of place in a foreign land.
