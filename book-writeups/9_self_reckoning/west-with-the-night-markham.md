### **[ The Author: Beryl Markham (1902–1986) ]**

Born Beryl Clutterbuck, October 26, 1902, in Ashwell, Leicestershire, England, to English gentry who kept horses and excelled at fox hunting. At age three, moved with family to Njoro, Kenya (then British East Africa), where her father Charles established a farm in a traditional mud hut. Her mother Clara attempted pioneer life for one year before returning to England with Beryl's brother, leaving four-year-old Beryl behind—instilling lifelong mistrust of women. Raised by her father and neighboring Kipsigis tribesmen, she spoke Swahili as first language, hunted wild game with spears alongside Kipsigis boys (her best friend was Kibii, later arap Ruta), learned horsemanship from her father with cavalry-cadet precision. Attended English school in Nairobi during World War I but struggled with rules, preferring the wildness she'd known. At seventeen, married Jock Purves, a Scotsman twice her age who ran her father's sawmill—disastrous marriage marred by his drinking and her infidelities (rumor held their marital home had a door hammered with brass nails, one for each affair). Left him in 1922. Became Africa's first licensed female racehorse trainer, breeding champions. Torrid love affairs included Great White Hunter Bror von Blixen (Karen Blixen's ex-husband) and Denys Finch-Hatton (the pilot and safari guide immortalized in *Out of Africa*). Finch-Hatton took her flying, thrilling her beyond measure. Tragically died in plane crash May 1931. Weeks later, Markham took her first solo flight—testament to courage that loss of her great love only cemented her aviation obsession. Became first woman in Kenya to receive commercial pilot's license, worked six years as bush pilot, air postal service, rescue missions, scouting elephants for safaris over unmapped East Africa. September 4, 1936: departed Abingdon, England, in Percival Vega Gull VP-KCC named *The Messenger*, attempting first solo non-stop flight from England to North America (east to west against prevailing winds—harder than Lindbergh's westbound journey). After twenty hours, fuel starvation from icing forced crash-landing at Baleine Cove, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Survived with forehead gash. Became instant international celebrity—first woman to cross Atlantic east-to-west solo, first person from England to North America non-stop eastward. Moved to California late 1930s. Married Raoul Schumacher, shadowy writer, 1942 (third marriage). *West with the Night* published 1942, appeared on thirteen bestseller lists, praised by Hemingway, then vanished in World War II chaos. Went out of print. Separated from Schumacher 1948, divorced 1960. Returned to Kenya 1952, resumed racehorse training, winning Kenya Derby six years, top trainer award five years. Lived in poverty on small royal family trust fund. 1983: Book rediscovered after restaurateur George Gutekunst read Hemingway's letters praising it, republished by North Point Press, became bestseller again. Schumacher claimed authorship—controversy persists. Evidence suggests Markham wrote it (manuscripts sent to editor before meeting Schumacher, dictated to him while in Bahamas where he never visited, handwritten edits in her hand). Most scholars accept Schumacher edited skillfully but Markham authored. Died August 3, 1986, Nairobi, age eighty-three, having lived life defined by autonomy, adventure, aviation.

### **[ The Book: *West with the Night* ]**

Not complete autobiography but selective memoir chronicling Kenyan childhood (1900s-1920s) and aviation career culminating in Atlantic crossing. Opens with Proustian question: "How is it possible to bring order out of memory?" Then plunges into vivid episodes arranged thematically rather than chronologically. The Africa she describes no longer exists—"wild and untamed, even as it is punctuated by British colonialism." She describes it with poet's feeling, adventurer's response, philosopher's evaluation. The prose is lyrical, sometimes baroque, occasionally breathtaking. Hemingway—rarely complimentary toward fellow writers—wrote to his publisher Maxwell Perkins: "She has written so well, and marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a writer. I felt that I was simply a carpenter with words, picking up whatever was furnished on the job and nailing them together and sometimes making an okay pig pen. But [she] can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves writers." (He also called her "a high-grade bitch," which says more about Hemingway than Markham.)

The book weaves between three passions: flying, horses, Africa. Early chapters recount wild childhood—hunting alongside Kipsigis warriors, encountering lions, learning the land's ancient wisdom. She writes: "Africa is of an ancient age and the blood of many of her peoples is as venerable and as chaste as truth." Colonial perspective infuses the language (published 1940s), which modern readers may find troubling, yet she honors Africa's natural uniqueness with genuine reverence. Central sections detail her years as bush pilot—rescue missions across desolate unmapped stretches, scouting game for safaris, mail runs to remote outposts, flying passengers who trust their lives to her skill. Vivid, suspenseful passages capture what it means to navigate by instinct when maps don't exist and radio silence leaves you alone above emptiness.

The titular chapter describes the Atlantic crossing itself. John Carberry challenged her: "A number of pilots have flown the North Atlantic, west to east. Only Jim Mollison has done it alone the other way—from Ireland. Nobody has done it alone from England—man or woman. I'd be interested in that, but nothing else. If you want to try it, Burl, I'll back you." She accepts despite understanding the danger—several women died attempting it. The writing becomes taut, immediate as she describes flying through darkness above "all that black water," fuel gauges dropping, ice forming, exhaustion threatening consciousness, and finally the crash-landing that ends the journey short of New York but alive.

What elevates the book beyond adventure tale is Markham's philosophical sensibility. She writes about fate, courage, solitude's necessity, what it means to pit oneself against relentless Nature. "The abhorrence of loneliness is as natural as wanting to live at all," she admits, yet shows how solitude strengthens rather than diminishes her. Critics praised it as "more than an autobiography; it is a poet's feeling for her land; an adventurer's response to life; a philosopher's evaluation of human beings and human destinies."

The book sold modestly initially, overshadowed by World War II, went out of print for forty years. Markham received small royalties, then nothing. Rediscovery in 1983 brought enormous success—first printing 5,000 copies, then 9,100, then 15,000, then 100,000 more. She received royalties during her final years. National Geographic Adventure ranked it #8 on list of 100 best adventure books (2004). Considered classic of outdoor literature. But authorship controversy haunted republication—Schumacher's friends claimed he wrote it. Most evidence refutes this. The narrative perspective is utterly Markham's even if Schumacher helped edit. As one scholar notes: "too detailed and too impassioned to have been written at second hand."
