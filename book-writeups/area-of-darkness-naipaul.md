### **[ The Journey ]**

V.S. Naipaul traveled to India in 1962. He was a man looking for a home that did not exist. He was born in Trinidad and raised in England. India was the ghost of his ancestors. He expected a spiritual homecoming. Instead, he found a land that horrified him.

The book is a record of his visceral shock. Naipaul does not look away from the grime or the poverty. He describes the public defecation on the streets of Mumbai. He mocks the rigid and suffocating bureaucracy of Delhi. He writes about the "mimicry" of a nation trying to act like its former British masters.

His perspective is famously cold. He is a man caught between worlds. He looks like the people around him, but he thinks like a Westerner. This creates a deep and painful friction. He feels a sense of shame for a country he cannot claim. He feels an anger toward a people who cannot see their own decay.

It is a brutal and brilliant piece of writing. It is not a book for people seeking enlightenment in an ashram. It is a book about the agony of belonging. Naipaul breaks the myth of the "mystic East" with a clinical and sharp intelligence. He leaves the country feeling more like an outsider than when he arrived.
