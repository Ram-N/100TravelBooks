### **[ The Author: Laurie Lee (1914–1997) ]**

Laurie Lee was born in the Cotswolds of England. He is best known for his masterpiece *Cider with Rosie*. He was a man who lived through the senses. He was a poet and a screenwriter but his greatest gift was his memory. He could recall the exact smell of a dusty road or the taste of a bitter orange from forty years prior. He had a restless spirit. In 1934 he simply walked away from his village and never really stopped looking for the next horizon.

### **[ The Book: *As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning* ]**

In the summer of 1934 Laurie Lee left his home with nothing but a violin in a cloth bag and a small bundle of clothes. He walked to London and then he caught a boat to Spain. He did not speak the language. He had very little money. He decided to walk from the north coast all the way to the south. He supported himself by playing his violin in the streets and squares of Spanish towns.

The writing is lush and incredibly vivid. He describes the Spanish landscape as a place of brutal heat and ancient beauty. He walks through the high plains of Castile and the orange groves of the south. He sleeps in fields and in cheap inns. He meets a cast of characters that feel like they stepped out of a painting. There are generous peasants and suspicious priests and beautiful girls who dance in the street.

But there is a shadow over the beauty. He arrived in Spain just as the country was sliding toward its bloody Civil War. He sees the tension in the faces of the people. He watches the strikes and the protests. He hears the whispers of revolution. He describes the violence that begins to break out in the streets of Malaga. He eventually has to be rescued by a British destroyer as the war explodes around him.

He writes with a dramatic flair about the loss of innocence. He shows us a Spain that was about to be destroyed forever. It is a world of tradition and poverty and intense passion. His voice is colloquial and warm. He makes you feel the dust on your skin and the hunger in your belly. It is a celebration of youth and the courage it takes to just keep walking.
