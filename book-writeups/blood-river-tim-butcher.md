### **[ The Author: Tim Butcher (1967–Present) ]**

Tim Butcher was a veteran foreign correspondent for the *Daily Telegraph*. He spent years covering the world's most dangerous conflicts from the Balkans to Africa. He is a man with a steady pulse and a deep knowledge of African history. He became obsessed with the Congo River after reading about the Victorian explorers. He is a meticulous researcher who doesn't take unnecessary risks but he is willing to go where no Westerner has set foot in decades. He writes with a lean and muscular style that focuses on the facts and the grit of the journey.

### **[ The Book: *Blood River* ]**

In 2004 Tim Butcher set out to do something that everyone told him was impossible. He decided to follow the route of Henry Morton Stanley across the Democratic Republic of Congo. He wanted to travel 2,500 miles from the headwaters of the Congo River to the Atlantic Ocean. The country was shattered by years of civil war. The infrastructure had collapsed. The roads had been reclaimed by the jungle.

The writing is incredibly tense. Butcher doesn't rely on flowery language. He gives you the raw details. He travels by motorbike through mud that swallows wheels. He hitches rides on dugout canoes. He relies on a network of aid workers and local "fixers" who risk their lives to move him through territory controlled by various rebel groups. He describes the "green wall" of the forest that feels like it is trying to squeeze the life out of the villages.

He uses the ghost of Stanley as his guide. He compares the vibrant and relatively organized Congo of the 1870s to the ruined and broken land of the 21st century. He shows us that in the Congo the schools and the clinics and the railways have all disappeared. It is a terrifying look at how a civilization can actually go backward. He has a dramatic flair for capturing the moments of pure fear—the sound of a distant gunshot or the look in a child soldier's eyes. This is not a vacation. It is a high-stakes investigation into the heart of a "failed state."
