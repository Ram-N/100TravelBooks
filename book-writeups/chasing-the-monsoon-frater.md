### **[ The Author: Alexander Frater (1937–2020) ]**

Alexander Frater was a British-Australian journalist who spent his childhood on a South Pacific island. For him, rain wasn't an inconvenience. It was the rhythm of life. In 1987, while recovering from a neck injury in a London hospital, a conversation with an Indian couple sparked a dormant obsession. He decided to follow the Indian summer monsoon from its "burst" in the south all the way to the wettest place on earth. Frater was a man of immense charm and a wry, understated wit. He didn't just report on the weather. He treated the monsoon like a living, breathing celebrity.

### **[ The Book: *Chasing the Monsoon* ]**

This is a "modern pilgrimage" through the heart of India. In 1987, India was suffering from a brutal heatwave and a failing economy. Everyone was waiting for the rain. Frater arrived in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram) just as the monsoon was predicted to strike. His goal was simple but difficult. He wanted to stay with the rain clouds as they moved north.

The writing is conversational and incredibly direct. Frater describes the "anticipation" of the rain as a physical weight. He spends time in the Indian Meteorological Department, where the scientists are treated like high priests. He uses small paragraphs to capture the sudden, violent beauty of the "burst"—the moment the sky finally opens up and the dust turns to life.

He has a dramatic flair for the obstacles he faced. He had to battle the legendary Indian bureaucracy to get a permit for Cherrapunji. At the time, the northeast was restricted for foreigners. He writes with colorful detail about the people he met—from the poet Kamala Das to hotel waiters who could predict the rain by the behavior of dragonflies.

He notes that for the wealthy, the monsoon is a time for parties and "monsoon feelings" of love and longing. For the poor, it is a struggle for survival. He even captures the political stakes. He mentions that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s political future practically depended on the rain. This is a book about how a single weather pattern can define the identity of a billion people.
