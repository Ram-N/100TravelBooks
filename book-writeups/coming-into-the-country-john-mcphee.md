### **[ The Author: John McPhee (1931–Present) ]**

John McPhee is a legend of long-form journalism. He has written for *The New Yorker* for decades and he is famous for his ability to make any subject—from geology to oranges—absolutely fascinating. He is a master of structure. He doesn't just write a story; he builds it like a piece of fine furniture. He is quiet and observant and he has a rare gift for getting people to talk. He writes with a technical precision that is never boring. He is a writer’s writer who finds the epic in the ordinary.

### **[ The Book: *Coming into the Country* ]**

This is the definitive book on Alaska. Written in the mid-1970s, it captures the state at a turning point. The oil pipeline was being built and the old wilderness was being measured and mapped. McPhee divides the book into three distinct journeys. He travels through the deep bush, looks at the chaotic politics of the capital, and spends time with the "river people" on the upper Yukon.

The writing is filled with colorful details and a dramatic flair for character. He introduces us to bush pilots who fly by the seat of their pants and settlers who live in cabins hundreds of miles from the nearest road. He describes the sheer scale of the land—the "big empty" that can swallow a person whole. He uses small paragraphs to break down the complex laws of land ownership and the gritty reality of panning for gold.

The heart of the book is the struggle between those who want to preserve the land and those who want to use it. McPhee doesn't take sides. He shows us the beauty of a wild river and the desperation of a man trying to make a living in a frozen wasteland. He makes you feel the bite of the cold and the buzzing of the summer mosquitoes. He shows that Alaska is not just a place on a map. It is a dream of total freedom that is often as dangerous as it is beautiful.
