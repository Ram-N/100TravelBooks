### **[ The Author: Tim Slessor (1931–Present) ]**

Tim Slessor was a young BBC filmmaker and geographer who, in 1955, joined five other recent graduates from Oxford and Cambridge for an impossible task. They wanted to do what no one had ever done: drive from London to Singapore. This was a time before GPS, before reliable maps of the interior of Asia, and before most of the roads they traveled actually existed. Slessor was the expedition’s scribe, documenting the journey with a quintessentially British "stiff upper lip" mixed with a dry, self-deprecating humor that made the most harrowing life-or-death situations sound like a minor social awkwardness.

### **[ The Book: *First Overland* ]**

This is the definitive account of the **Oxford & Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition**. Six men in two Land Rover Series I vehicles (named *Oxford* and *Cambridge*) set out to prove that the "Stilwell Road"—the supply route from India to China carved out during WWII—was still passable.

The writing is direct, fast-paced, and incredibly scannable. Slessor avoids long-winded philosophy, focusing instead on the mechanics of travel. He uses small paragraphs to describe the sheer physical labor of the trip: winching the cars through waist-deep mud in Burma, navigating the treacherous Ledo Road, and crossing the desert heat of Iraq.

He provides colorful detail about the geopolitical state of the 1950s—a world where the British Empire was fading but "the old boy network" still opened doors in unlikely places. He has a dramatic flair for the camaraderie of the group. Despite being crammed into two tiny, un-airconditioned metal boxes for six months, they remained friends. It is a story of a world that was briefly "open" in a way it never would be again, captured by a man who knew they were making history one gear-crunch at a time.

### **[ The Signature Line ]**

> "We had done it. We had driven from London to Singapore. And the most remarkable thing was that the cars were still running."

### **[ The Perfect Pairing ]**

* **The Drink:** A lukewarm gin and tonic or a mug of strong, oily tea.
* **The Soundtrack:** The high-pitched whine of a low-range gearbox and the rhythmic clatter of a four-cylinder petrol engine.
* **The Setting:** A greasy garage floor in a foreign land, surrounded by spare parts and a half-unrolled map.
