### **[ The Author: Tiziano Terzani (1938–2004) ]**

Tiziano Terzani was a legendary Italian journalist. For decades he was the Asia correspondent for *Der Spiegel*. He witnessed the fall of Saigon and the rise of the Khmer Rouge. He was a man of the world—sharp, political, and deeply experienced. But in 1976 a Chinese fortune-teller in Hong Kong gave him a warning. The man told Terzani that in 1993 he must not fly. If he did he would die. Most people would forget such a thing but Terzani didn't. When 1993 arrived he decided to honor the prophecy. He spent the entire year traveling across Asia without ever leaving the ground.

### **[ The Book: *A Fortune-Teller Told Me* ]**

This book is the record of that year. It is a brilliant blend of travelogue and spiritual inquiry. By giving up planes Terzani was forced to slow down. He traveled by train and boat and bus and elephant. He rediscovered the "texture" of the world that aviation destroys.

The writing is direct and full of dramatic flair. Terzani uses his "no-fly" rule as an excuse to seek out every local seer and mystic he can find. He meets astrologers in Bangkok and palm readers in Rangoon. He writes with a colorful detail about their methods. He is often skeptical but he is never dismissive. He realizes that in Asia "magic" is often just a different way of looking at the truth.

He uses small paragraphs to capture the sensory overload of the journey. He describes the slow chug of a train through the jungle and the smell of incense in a mountain temple. He also writes about the tragedy of "modernization." He sees Asia losing its soul to malls and plastic. He argues that by ignoring the irrational and the spiritual we are becoming poorer as a species.

The climax of the book is chilling. In 1993 a UN helicopter crashed in Cambodia. Every journalist on board died. Terzani was supposed to be on that flight. The prophecy had been right. This realization turns the book from a travel adventure into a deep meditation on fate. It is a story about a man who saved his life by slowing his pace.
