### **[ The Author: Bill Adler ]**

Bill Adler is a writer with a knack for finding the extraordinary in the mundane. In the mid-1980s, he decided to bypass the "sterile" experience of flying and the isolation of driving. Instead, he bought a bus pass and committed himself to thousands of miles of public transportation. Adler is a man of immense patience and a sharp, comedic wit. He has a gift for eavesdropping and a genuine curiosity about the lives of the people who have no choice but to take the bus. He doesn't look down on his fellow passengers; he looks at them with the eye of a biographer.

### **[ The Book: *The Great American Bus Ride* ]**

This is an odyssey of the American interstate system. Adler spent months zigzagging across the lower 48 states, living on a "bus-time" schedule where delay is the only certainty.

The writing is direct, conversational, and often very funny. Adler uses small paragraphs to describe the sensory experience of the bus—the smell of diesel, the flickering fluorescent lights of 3:00 AM depots, and the peculiar "bus-lag" that sets in after forty-eight hours on the road. He has a dramatic flair for the characters he encounters: the runaway teenagers, the weary soldiers, the itinerant preachers, and the elderly women traveling three days to visit a grandchild.

He provides colorful detail about the architecture of the bus stations—from the art deco terminals of the big cities to the gas-station-corners of the rural South. He writes about the "Great American Bus Ride" as a democratic space where people of all races and classes are forced into a temporary, vibrating community. He captures a version of America that is often ignored: the gritty, honest, and surprisingly kind world that exists between the exits of the highway. It is a story about the beauty of the journey when the destination is an afterthought.
