### **[ The Book ]**

Peter Hopkirk was not your average historian. He was a man who had been arrested for spying in real life. He understood the smell of trouble. In this book he takes us back to the 1800s. Two giants are waking up. The British are sitting in India and they are nervous. The Russians are moving south through the deserts. They are swallowing up ancient kingdoms one by one. This is the Great Game.

It was a war fought with maps and mirrors instead of just cannons. Brave men put on disguises. They pretended to be holy men or horse traders. They climbed over frozen mountain peaks that no westerner had ever seen. They were looking for the secret ways to invade India.

If they were caught they did not get a trial. They got a quick death in a dusty town. They were often left to rot in stone pits while their kings in London and St. Petersburg argued over borders.

The stories are wild. You read about an entire British army being wiped out in the Afghan snow. Only one man survived that retreat. You hear about spies who vanished into the mountains and were never seen again. Some were found years later as skeletons in the desert.

Hopkirk writes with a flair for the dramatic. He makes the dusty records of the past feel like a tense thriller. He shows how the lines drawn on a map by a bored clerk in London could change the world forever. It is a story of ego and bravery and the birth of modern politics.
