### **[ The Author: Roy Moxham ]**

Roy Moxham was a conservator at the University of London library. He was a man used to the quiet of stacks and the smell of old parchment. He wasn't an explorer. But one day he stumbled across a footnote in an old book about a "Customs Hedge" in India. It was described as a massive wall of living thorns, twelve feet high and thousands of miles long. Moxham became obsessed. He couldn't believe something so huge could be forgotten. He decided to go to India to see if any trace of this "Great Hedge" still existed. He is a writer of great patience and a dry, understated humor.

### **[ The Book: *The Great Hedge of India* ]**

This is a detective story. Moxham starts in the archives of London and eventually finds himself on the back of a motorcycle in the rural heart of India. The "Great Hedge" was built by the British in the 19th century to enforce a brutal salt tax. It was a physical barrier designed to stop smugglers. It was made of Indian plum, babool, and prickly pear. At its peak, it was 2,300 miles long and guarded by 12,000 men.

The writing is direct and incredibly conversational. Moxham uses small paragraphs to describe his frustrations with Indian bureaucracy and his excitement when he finds a clue. He has a dramatic flair for the "eureka" moments. He describes the heat of the plains and the bewilderment of the local villagers when an Englishman shows up asking about a wall of thorns that disappeared a hundred years ago.

The book is filled with colorful details about the salt trade and the madness of colonial administration. Moxham realizes that the hedge was a symbol of oppression. The salt tax hit the poorest Indians the hardest. As he searches for the remains of the hedge, he is also uncovering the dark underbelly of the Raj. It is a story about the intersection of nature and politics. In the end, he finds more than just thorns. He finds a piece of lost history that the world had tried to prune away.
