### **[ The Author: Isabella Bird (1831–1904) ]**

Isabella Bird was a woman of two lives. Back in England she was a sickly clergyman’s daughter who spent her days on a sofa with spinal pain. But the moment she left home she became a powerhouse. She traveled through Hawaii and Japan and Tibet and Korea. She was the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. She found that the crisp air and the physical struggle of the wilderness were the only cures for her "nerves." She rode horses like a man—astride rather than side-saddle—and she didn't care who saw her doing it.

### **[ The Book: *A Lady’s Life in the Rocky Mountains* ]**

This book is a collection of letters she wrote to her sister Henrietta in 1873. Isabella was traveling through the Colorado Territory when it was still a raw and lawless frontier. She wasn't staying in hotels. She was living in drafty cabins and riding through blizzards that would have killed a lesser traveler.

The writing is packed with colorful details and a dramatic flair for the rugged life. She describes her home base in Estes Park—a high mountain valley that she calls "noisier with the sounds of animals than with the sounds of men." She lived there in a cabin during a brutal winter when the temperature dropped far below zero. She spent her days chopping wood and herding cattle and her nights writing by the light of a flickering fire.

The most famous part of the book is her relationship with "Rocky Mountain Jim." He was a one-eyed desperado and an outlaw with a violent reputation. He fell in love with the refined but fearless Isabella. She saw the poetry in his soul and the tragedy of his life. Together they climbed Longs Peak—a 14,000-foot monster of a mountain. Isabella did it in her heavy skirts and a pair of boots that were falling apart. She describes the climb with a breathless intensity that makes your own lungs ache.

She writes with a sharp and direct style. She uses small paragraphs to capture the sudden changes in the weather and the sheer scale of the peaks. She loves the wildness of the West and she mourns the fact that the "tourists" and the "civilizers" are already on their way. It is a book about a woman who finally found a place that was as big as her spirit.
