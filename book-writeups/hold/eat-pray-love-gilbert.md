### **[ The Author: Elizabeth Gilbert (1969–Present) ]**

Elizabeth Gilbert was a successful writer living a life that looked perfect on paper. She had the house and the husband and the career. But she was miserable. She famously spent nights sobbing on her bathroom floor. She decided to blow up her life and start over. She did not just go on a vacation. She went on a mission to find her own joy. She is honest and funny and she is not afraid to look a little bit crazy in pursuit of her soul.

### **[ The Book: *Eat Pray Love* ]**

This book is divided into three sections like a perfect meal. The first stop is Italy. Gilbert goes there to remember how to eat. She ignores her weight and her worries. She falls in love with the language and the simple magic of a perfect pizza in Naples. She describes the food with such passion that you can almost smell the garlic on the page. She learns that pleasure is not a sin. It is a necessity.

The second stop is India. This is where things get difficult. She lives in an ashram and wakes up before dawn to chant. She struggles with the silence and the heat. She battles her own mind in the meditation hall. She meets a Texan named Richard who gives her the tough love she needs. She learns how to forgive herself for her past mistakes. She finds a quiet center that she never knew she had.

The final stop is Bali. This is the place of balance. She returns to visit an old medicine man named Ketut Liyer. He is a tiny man with no teeth and a giant smile. He teaches her how to live in the world without losing her peace. She meets a Brazilian man and falls in love again. She realizes that she does not have to choose between God and the world. She can have both.

The writing is conversational and very direct. Gilbert talks to the reader like a best friend. She uses small paragraphs and fills them with colorful details. She makes the spiritual path feel like something anyone can walk. She does not hide her flaws or her fears. She shows that it is okay to be a mess as long as you keep moving forward. It is a dramatic and heart-felt story about a woman who refused to settle for a life she did not want.
