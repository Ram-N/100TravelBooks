### **[ The Journey ]**

In 1914, Ernest Shackleton set out to do something that sounded impossible. He wanted to lead a team across the entire continent of Antarctica on foot. He had a sturdy ship named the *Endurance* and a crew of twenty-seven brave men. They sailed into the Weddell Sea just as the Great War was beginning in Europe. They had no idea that they were heading into one of the greatest survival stories ever told.

The ice did not play fair. Before they could even reach the coast, the pack ice closed in around the ship. It held the *Endurance* fast for months. The men could only watch and listen as the ice began to crush the hull. The sound was like artillery fire. Eventually, the ship was splintered into pieces. It sank into the freezing depths. The crew was left standing on a floating piece of ice with no way to call for help.

### **[ The Deep Dive ]**

Alfred Lansing wrote this book decades after the event. He used the private diaries of the men to reconstruct every grueling detail. His writing is sharp and fast. He makes you feel the bite of the sub-zero wind. You can almost taste the fried seal blubber. The drama comes from the sheer hopelessness of their situation. They were thousands of miles from civilization. They were drifting on a melting ice floe in a sea filled with killer whales.

The story reaches a fever pitch when the ice finally breaks up. The men took to three tiny lifeboats. They battled giant waves and freezing spray to reach the rocky shores of Elephant Island. But they were still not safe. Shackleton knew they would rot there if he didn't do something desperate. He took five men in a twenty-two foot boat called the *James Caird*. They launched into the Drake Passage. This is the most violent stretch of ocean on the planet.

They sailed 800 miles to reach South Georgia Island. It was a feat of navigation that defies logic. When they landed, they had to climb over jagged, uncharted mountains to reach a whaling station. They had no tents or climbing gear. They used screws from the boat in their boots for grip. In the end, against every possible odd, Shackleton did not lose a single man. Lansing shows us that leadership is not about the glory of the goal. It is about the survival of the soul.
