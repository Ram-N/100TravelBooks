### **[ The Author: Bruce Chatwin (1940–1989) ]**

Bruce Chatwin was a meteoric figure in 20th-century literature. He began as a prodigy at Sotheby’s, becoming one of their youngest directors, before abruptly quitting to pursue a life of nomadism. He famously sent a telegram to his employer at *The Sunday Times* that simply read: *"Gone to Patagonia for six months."* Chatwin was obsessed with why humans wander, and his writing—spare, crystalline, and often blurring the line between fact and fiction—effectively revitalized the travel genre for a modern audience.

### **[ The Book: *In Patagonia* ]**

Triggered by a childhood obsession with a scrap of "brontosaurus skin" (actually a giant sloth) kept in his grandmother’s cabinet, Chatwin travels to the "uttermost part of the earth." The book is structured as a series of 97 short, sharp vignettes. Instead of a linear journey, it is a mosaic of encounters: Welsh immigrants clinging to their language in the desert, descendants of Butch Cassidy, and lonely gauchos. It is less about the destination and more about the "internal landscape" of those who choose to live at the edge of the world.
