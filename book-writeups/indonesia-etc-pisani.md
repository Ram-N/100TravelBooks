### **[ The Author: Elizabeth Pisani (1964–Present) ]**

Elizabeth Pisani is a former journalist and epidemiologist with a sharp, scientific mind and a very low tolerance for nonsense. She spent years living in Jakarta and working as an HIV researcher. She speaks Indonesian fluently and she understands the "invisible" logic of the country better than almost any outsider. She is witty and fearless and she isn't afraid to ask uncomfortable questions. She writes with a dry humor that makes even complex topics like bureaucratic corruption feel like a high-stakes comedy.

### **[ The Book: *Indonesia, Etc.* ]**

The title comes from the 1945 Declaration of Independence. It was a short document that essentially said Indonesia was free and that the details would be worked out "by the shortest possible means, etc." Pisani decides to spend a year traveling through those "etcs." She avoids the tourist traps and heads for the deep interior of the archipelago.

She travels by rickety ferries and motorbikes and buses that are falling apart. She stays with local families and attends elaborate funerals in Sumba where buffalo are sacrificed in the street. She explores the massive contradictions of the nation. It is a place where radical Islam lives alongside ancient animist rituals. It is a place where people are incredibly hospitable but also deeply suspicious of the central government in Jakarta.

The writing is conversational and very direct. Pisani breaks the book down into themes like "God" and "Money" and "People." She uses small paragraphs to explain the "Big Man" politics that run the remote islands. She has a dramatic flair for describing the chaos of a midnight boat crossing or the intensity of a local political rally. She shows that the glue holding Indonesia together is a mix of compromise and "jam karet" (rubber time).

This is a brilliant portrait of a nation that shouldn't exist but does. Pisani doesn't look for a "pure" Indonesia. She looks for the messy truth. She captures the colorful details of the markets and the quiet dignity of the farmers. It is a book for anyone who wants to see the world as it really is.
