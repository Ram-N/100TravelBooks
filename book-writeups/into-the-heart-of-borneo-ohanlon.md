### **[ The Author: Redmond O’Hanlon (b. 1947) ]**

Redmond O’Hanlon is an English writer, literary scholar, and naturalist, celebrated for a string of wildly uncomfortable expeditions turned into exuberant travel books. Trained in English literature at Oxford, he worked as a critic and editor before discovering travel writing in his late thirties and realizing that he could chase the “blank spots” of Victorian exploration with modern eyes. His first travel book, *Into the Heart of Borneo*, was followed by *In Trouble Again*, *Congo Journey* (published as *No Mercy* in the US), and *Trawler*, each built around an improbable, often risky quest through jungle, swamp, or storm-tossed sea. Alongside the pratfalls and self-mockery, O’Hanlon brings a serious interest in zoology, ecology, and the legacy of 19th‑century explorers, making him one of the key figures in late‑20th‑century British travel writing.

### **[ The Book: *Into the Heart of Borneo* ]**

Into the Heart of Borneo follows O’Hanlon and poet James Fenton as they leave Kuching in Sarawak and push upriver by a succession of longboats toward the remote slopes of Mount Batu Tiban, on the Indonesian border. Their nominal goal is to rediscover signs of the Bornean rhinoceros and to retrace a 1926 British expedition; in practice, the journey becomes a test of stamina and a laboratory for cross‑cultural misunderstanding as they depend on three Iban guides to navigate rapids, politics, and jungle trails. Days of slogging through mud, swarms of leeches, sodden kit, and precarious river travel are punctuated by longhouse hospitality, tuak‑fuelled feasts, and stories that hint at older histories of head‑hunting and intertribal rivalry.  

The book’s power lies in its tone. O’Hanlon writes as a self‑deprecating, often ridiculous outsider who is nonetheless a precise observer of birds, insects, river systems, and forest ecology. He punctures his own discomfort with jokes while quietly registering the skill, patience, and good humor of his Iban companions, avoiding romanticism without slipping into condescension. Set in the early 1980s, the journey also captures a moment when interior Borneo was still comparatively roadless yet already threatened by logging and habitat loss. The result is a travel narrative that manages to be laugh‑out‑loud funny, scientifically attentive, and quietly elegiac about a rainforest world under pressure.

### **[ Destinations Explored ]**

* **Kuching, Sarawak:** Laid‑back riverside capital on the South China Sea, staging point for supplies, permits, and last civilized comforts.  
* **The Batang Rejang and tributary rivers:** Longboat highways into the interior, where rapids, submerged rocks, and sudden storms turn transport into adventure.  
* **Iban longhouse settlements in Sarawak’s interior:** Elevated communal homes that anchor village life, ritual, and storytelling along the forested rivers.  
* **Border highlands toward Mount Batu Tiban:** Steep, wet jungle country on the Sarawak–Kalimantan frontier, where the party pushes on foot in search of rhino country and “the middle of the map.”

### **[ Further Reading ]**

**By Redmond O’Hanlon:**  

* ***In Trouble Again***: A hazardous, often absurd journey up the Orinoco and into the Venezuelan and Colombian rainforest, expanding his mix of natural history and comic ordeal.  
* ***Congo Journey*** (*No Mercy*): A darker, more hallucinatory overland trip through the Congo Basin, confronting colonial legacies, riverine myth, and ecological fragility.  

**In a Similar Vein:**  

* ***A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush*** by Eric Newby: Another hilariously underprepared expedition—this time to the mountains of Afghanistan—balancing self‑mockery with moments of genuine awe.  
* ***The Songlines*** by Bruce Chatwin: A more meditative, speculative journey across Australia, blending anthropology, myth, and restless walking in a similarly genre‑bending style.

### **[ The Signature Line ]**

> “It is one thing to read about jungles in the safety of a library, quite another to find that every inch of the world around you crawls, slithers, bites or drips—and that, despite yourself, you are exhilarated.”

### **[ The Perfect Pairing ]**

* **The Drink:** Iced sweet tea or cold lager beading on the glass, to echo tropical humidity without replicating the hardship.  
* **The Soundtrack:** Nighttime rainforest recordings—cicadas, frogs, distant thunder—layered under occasional snatches of Iban song.  
* **The Setting:** A warm evening on a balcony or porch, with a ceiling fan turning lazily and a map of Borneo close to hand to trace the upriver route.
