### **[ The Author: Jon Krakauer (b. 1954) ]**

Jon Krakauer is an American writer and mountaineer known for deeply reported narratives about risk, obsession, and the mountains and wildlands that attract driven people. After college he worked odd jobs while climbing in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, gaining first‑hand experience of the thin line between adventure and disaster. He began writing for magazines such as *Outside* before expanding a 1993 article on Christopher McCandless into *Into the Wild*, which became his breakthrough book. Krakauer followed it with *Into Thin Air*, *Under the Banner of Heaven*, and other works, cementing a reputation for blending investigative reporting with a participant’s understanding of fear, ambition, and the ethics of extreme choices. His work often probes the myths Americans tell about self‑reliance and transcendence in harsh landscapes.

### **[ The Book: *Into the Wild* ]**

*Into the Wild* reconstructs the life and death of Christopher McCandless, a gifted Emory University graduate who, in 1990, gave away his savings, cut ties with his family, and set out across North America under the name “Alexander Supertramp.” Over two years he hitchhikes through the American West, canoes down the Colorado River to Mexico, works odd jobs, and forms brief, intense friendships with people who are alternately inspired and baffled by his determination to live simply and autonomously. In the spring of 1992 he heads to Alaska, walking up the Stampede Trail near Denali with minimal gear and food, eventually holing up in an abandoned bus where, after several months of isolation, he dies of starvation and related weakness.  

Krakauer braids McCandless’s story with his own youthful experiences in dangerous landscapes and with case studies of other wanderers drawn fatally toward the wild. He refuses to dismiss McCandless simply as reckless or arrogant, instead exploring how family conflict, literary influences, and American frontier mythology shaped the young man’s choices. The narrative moves between road‑trip encounters, investigative interviews, and reflective passages on risk, responsibility, and the limits of romantic individualism. The result is a travel narrative turned moral inquiry, asking whether the search for authenticity in wild places can justify the pain left behind—and what “going into the wild” really means in the late 20th century.

### **[ The Signature Line ]**

> At its heart, *Into the Wild* suggests that McCandless’s real journey is not just a line on a map toward Alaska, but a collision between private idealism and the unforgiving facts of weather, hunger, and human attachment.
