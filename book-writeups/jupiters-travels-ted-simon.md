### **[ The Author: Ted Simon (1931–Present) ]**

Ted Simon is the patron saint of long-distance motorcyclists. In 1973 he was a journalist in London who felt like he was stagnating. He wasn't a master mechanic and he wasn't a professional racer. He was just a man with a wild idea. He decided to ride a motorcycle around the world alone. He spent four years on the road covering 64,000 miles through 45 countries. He writes with a quiet and thoughtful dignity. He doesn't brag about his speed. He reflects on his fear and his wonder. He is a man who went looking for the "oneness" of humanity and found it in the dirt of a dozen different borders.

### **[ The Book: *Jupiter’s Travels* ]**

This is the book that launched a thousand journeys. It is the bible of "overlanding." Ted Simon set off on a 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 at a time when there were no GPS devices and no cell phones. If he broke down in the middle of the Ethiopian desert he had to fix it himself or wait for a miracle.

The writing is conversational and deeply personal. Simon doesn't just describe the scenery. He describes the psychological toll of being alone for years. He writes about the "Jupiter" in him—the part of his personality that pushed him forward even when he was exhausted or terrified. He uses small paragraphs to capture the suddenness of a crash or the beauty of a sunset in the Andes. He has a dramatic flair for describing the people he met—from high-ranking officials to peasants who shared their last bit of bread with him.

He spent time in an Israeli jail and worked on a commune in California. He survived tropical diseases and mechanical failures that would have sent most people home. The book is about the "interconnectedness" of the world. He shows that despite the wars and the borders people everywhere are essentially the same. They want to be heard and they want to be helpful. It is a story about the ultimate loss of ego. By the time he returns to London he is a completely different man.
