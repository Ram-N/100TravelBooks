### **[ The Author: Ernesto Guevara (1928–1967) ]**

Before he was "Che," the revolutionary icon in the beret, he was Ernesto. He was a middle-class medical student from Argentina with a severe case of asthma and a restless soul. He was a bookworm who loved poetry and philosophy. He was also a man who couldn't stay still. This journey was the hinge of his life. It transformed him from a curious student into a man who felt the pain of an entire continent. He wrote with a sharp eye for detail and a growing sense of indignation at the poverty he witnessed.

### **[ The Book: *The Motorcycle Diaries* ]**

In 1952, Ernesto and his friend Alberto Granado hopped on a leaky, backfiring 1939 Norton 500 motorcycle they called *La Poderosa* ("The Mighty One"). Their goal was simple: to see the South America they had only read about in books. They headed north from Buenos Aires with very little money and a lot of confidence.

The motorcycle did not live up to its name. It broke down constantly. They crashed into ditches. They slept in barns and police stations. Eventually, the bike gave up the ghost entirely in Chile, and they continued as hitchhikers and stowaways. The writing starts as a lighthearted adventure full of humor and youthful ego. They chase girls and trick locals into giving them free meals.

But as they move deeper into the continent, the tone shifts. Ernesto sees the brutal conditions of the copper miners in Chile. He sees the remnants of the Inca civilization in Peru and the crushing poverty of the indigenous people. The turning point is their stay at a leper colony in the Amazon. There, Ernesto realizes that the "oneness" of Latin America is more important than national borders.

The prose is conversational and direct. He uses small paragraphs to capture the dust of the road and the cold of the Andes. He has a dramatic flair for the poetic moment—a conversation with a communist couple under the stars or a solitary swim across a river. By the end of the book, the carefree student is gone. He has found his cause.
