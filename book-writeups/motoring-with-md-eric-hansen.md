### **[ The Author: Eric Hansen (b. c. 1947) ]**

Born around 1947, Eric Hansen studied industrial art and environmental design at the University of California before abandoning conventional career paths for a life of improbable journeys. He made his name in 1988 with *Stranger in the Forest*, documenting his seven-month, 1,500-mile trek across Borneo with Penan nomads—the first Westerner to accomplish the crossing on foot. Hansen approaches travel with a peculiar combination of meticulous preparation and willingness to throw plans out the window entirely. Based in San Francisco but rarely there, he has wandered through Europe, the Middle East, Australia, Nepal, and Southeast Asia for over four decades, somehow accumulating adventures that sound invented but are meticulously documented. His writing blends deadpan humor with genuine respect for the cultures he encounters, never positioning himself as the hero. He worked briefly at the Grand Hotel on Thursday Island as a maintenance worker in 1975, which tells you something about his relationship with conventional employment. His later work includes *Orchid Fever*, about the obsessive world of orchid smuggling, and *The Bird Man and the Lap Dancer*, a collection of encounters with strangers. Hansen writes for *National Geographic*, *The New York Times*, and *Outside*, among others, always seeking what's strange, unruly, and gloriously improbable.

### **[ The Book: *Motoring with Mohammed* ]**

This book begins with catastrophe: a 1978 storm in the Red Sea that leaves Hansen and four companions shipwrecked on an uninhabited island off Yemen's coast. Rescued by goat smugglers after burying seven years' worth of travel journals in the sand, Hansen arrives in North Yemen—a country he'd never intended to visit, having heard only that men wore skirts, chewed narcotic leaves, and celebrated circumcisions by throwing foreskins into jubilant crowds. A decade later in 1988, he returns to retrieve those journals, expecting a quick expedition. What follows is months of bureaucratic tangles, qat-chewing sessions, close calls near the Empty Quarter, and traveling with Mohammed, a guide perpetually seeking to cram one more sheep into his taxi's back seat.

The book's structure mirrors its subject: chaotic, digressive, yet somehow arriving exactly where it needs to be. Hansen encounters American expatriates counting bathroom patrons in Sana'a, a myopic British ornithologist, smugglers, fixers, gun runners, and an aging Frenchwoman under what he calls "a tragic spell." He describes the mud-brick skyscrapers of Sana'a, perched impossibly on cliff edges, the ancient dam at Ma'rib, and terrifying mountain passes where one wrong turn means plunging into the void. Throughout, there's qat—the mildly narcotic leaf Yemenis chew communally for hours, conducting business and friendship in a state of gentle intoxication.

The writing is light-handed and self-deprecating, Hansen presenting himself as perpetually befuddled by Yemen's customs yet embraced by its legendary hospitality. Speaking almost no Arabic, he nonetheless finds his way into conversations, bathhouses, prisons, and situations no sensible traveler would seek. The quest for the journals becomes almost MacGuffin-like; the real treasure is Hansen's portrait of a Yemen that no longer exists—pre-civil war, pre-famine, when the country remained one of the Arabian Peninsula's most enigmatic corners. The book delivers both laugh-out-loud comedy (that sheep really does ride in the back seat for days) and genuine adventure, all told with the timing of someone who knows the value of understatement.

### **[ Destinations Explored ]**

* **Uqban Island, Red Sea:** An uninhabited speck where Hansen buried his journals and survived shipwreck—twenty miles from Yemen, a world away from anywhere.
* **Sana'a:** Yemen's capital, a city of mud-brick towers that rise seven stories, decorated with white gypsum tracery and stained-glass windows—architectural poetry in the high desert.
* **The Tihama:** Yemen's scorching coastal plain, where temperatures soar and the Red Sea shimmers with mirages.
* **Ma'rib:** Site of the ancient Sabaean dam and the legendary Kingdom of Sheba, now surrounded by endless desert.
* **The Edge of the Empty Quarter:** Where Hansen clings to precipitous cliffs in driving rain, overlooking the Rub' al-Khali—one of Earth's great blank spaces.

**By Eric Hansen:**

* ***Stranger in the Forest***: Hansen's earlier masterpiece about walking across Borneo—more ambitious in scope, equally humble in tone.

**In a Similar Vein:**

* ***The Road to Oxiana*** by Robert Byron: Another traveler bumbling through Middle Eastern bureaucracy and absurdity while documenting architectural marvels—a spiritual predecessor.
