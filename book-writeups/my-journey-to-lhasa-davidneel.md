### **[ The Author: Alexandra David-Néel (1868–1969) ]**

Alexandra was a force of nature. She was a French opera singer, a journalist, and a serious Buddhist scholar. She was not a typical Victorian lady. She spent years living in caves and studying with monks in the Himalayas. She was a woman of fierce intellect and even fiercer willpower. She didn't just want to see the world. She wanted to master the secrets of the East. She was 55 years old when she pulled off her greatest feat. She lived to be over 100 and she was renewing her passport until the very end.

### **[ The Book: *My Journey to Lhasa* ]**

This is the account of an impossible mission. In the 1920s, Lhasa was the "Forbidden City." Foreigners were strictly banned and the borders were guarded by soldiers. Alexandra decided she was going in anyway. She didn't bring a caravan or a crew. She brought a young monk named Aphur Yongden and a very clever plan.

The writing is direct and full of dramatic flair. Alexandra describes how she disguised herself as a penniless beggar. She rubbed charcoal and cocoa on her face to darken her skin. She wore yak hair extensions to look like a local woman. She carried a hidden dagger and a small pistol under her rags. She and Yongden pretended to be mother and son on a religious pilgrimage.

They walked for months through the winter. They crossed mountain passes that were 19,000 feet high. They slept in the snow and ate dried yak meat that was as hard as a rock. Alexandra uses small paragraphs to capture the tension of every checkpoint. One wrong word or one look at her blue eyes would have meant prison or death. She writes with colorful detail about the festivals and the secret rituals she witnessed.

She finally reached Lhasa during a blinding dust storm. She stayed in the city for weeks without being caught. She watched the monks and visited the great temples. She was the first Western woman to ever see the heart of Tibet. This book is a record of a woman who refused to be told "no." It is a story of grit and a deep love for a culture that most people then thought was mysterious or scary.
