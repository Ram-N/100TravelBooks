### **[ The Author: Rian Malan (1954–Present) ]**

Rian Malan is a man born into a legacy of power and pain. He is a direct descendant of the architects of Apartheid. His great-uncle was the Prime Minister who helped formalize the system. Malan grew up as a "liberal" Afrikaner who hated the regime but couldn't escape his own skin. He fled to Los Angeles to live the life of a rock journalist but the ghosts of home eventually pulled him back. He writes with a raw and jagged honesty that feels like an open wound. He is a master of the uncomfortable truth.

### **[ The Book: *My Traitor’s Heart* ]**

This book is a scream of a memoir. Malan returns to South Africa in the mid-1980s as the country is burning. He wants to understand the violence that defines his homeland. He does not write a dry political history. Instead he tells a series of grisly and heartbreaking stories about murders. He looks at the "senseless" killings—the white couple murdered by their gardener or the black man beaten to death by white youths. He peels back the skin of these crimes to find the ancient fears underneath.

The writing is incredibly dramatic. Malan has a flair for the macabre. He uses small and punchy paragraphs to describe the heat and the dust and the blood. He doesn't take sides in the way you expect. He is critical of the white supremacists but he is also terrified of the revolutionary violence. He feels like a traitor to his race and a stranger to the revolution. He is caught in the middle and he is slowly losing his mind.

He digs into his own family history to find where the "poison" started. He goes back to the first Malans who arrived in Africa centuries ago. He shows how the landscape and the isolation turned a group of European farmers into a tribe obsessed with survival at any cost.

The book is a journey through a nightmare. But in the end Malan finds a tiny flicker of hope. He tells the story of Neil Alcock—a white man who lived in poverty to help a black community. Through Alcock he sees a different way to be African. It is a brutal and beautiful book. It is about the struggle to love a place that is trying to kill you. It is a travelogue of the soul in a land of fire.
