### **[ The Author: Norman Lewis (1908–2003) ]**

Norman Lewis was born in Enfield and he became one of the greatest travel writers of his time. He was a man who preferred the shadows to the spotlight. During the war he served in the British Intelligence Corps. This job gave him a front row seat to the collapse of civilizations. He had a rare gift for languages and a sharp eye for the absurd. He spent his long life traveling to places like Indochina and Ibiza. He always wrote with a cool and detached honesty. He never tried to make himself the hero of his own stories.

### **[ The Book: *Naples '44* ]**

Norman Lewis arrived in Naples in September 1943. He was part of the Allied liberation force. What he found was not a city in celebration but a city in agony. The people were eating tropical fish from the aquarium to stay alive. Women were selling their bodies for a tin of meat. Lewis was an intelligence officer but he spent most of his time listening to the heartbeats of the poor. He recorded the daily struggle for bread and dignity.

The book is a collection of diary entries that feel like scenes from a fever dream. He describes the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1944. It was a wall of fire that swallowed villages while the war continued just miles away. He tells stories of "professional mourners" who were paid to cry at funerals. He meets a man who claims to be a lawyer but spends his days catching small birds for his dinner. There is a dark and heavy humor in these pages. Lewis shows how the Neapolitans used their wit and their ancient superstitions to survive the modern machinery of war.

He writes about the "miracles" that the locals relied on. He watches the city wait for the blood of San Gennaro to liquefy. He sees the complex relationship between the locals and the Allied soldiers. The soldiers were often well-fed and confused by the chaos. Lewis does not judge the people for their desperation. He admires their ability to find beauty in the ruins. He shows that even in the middle of a global slaughter the small details of human life are what matter most. The writing is direct and clear. It is a portrait of a city that was stripped bare and yet refused to die.
