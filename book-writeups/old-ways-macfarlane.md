### **[ The Author: Robert Macfarlane (1976–Present) ]**

Robert Macfarlane is a man who loves words as much as he loves the wild. He is a Cambridge academic but he is most at home on a limestone ridge or a peat bog. He is the leading voice of a new generation of nature writers. He doesn't just describe a view. He digs into the "underland" and the deep history of a place. Macfarlane has a gift for finding ancient words for landscapes that we have nearly forgotten. He writes with a lyrical intensity that makes a simple walk feel like a religious experience.

### **[ The Book: *The Old Ways* ]**

This is the third book in a loose trilogy about the wild and the human heart. In *The Old Ways* Macfarlane sets out to explore the ancient tracks that crisscross Britain and the world. These are not modern roads. These are chalk paths and pilgrim routes and "sarn" or sea-roads that only appear when the tide is out. He believes that when we walk these paths we are stepping into the footprints of everyone who has gone before us.

He walks hundreds of miles. He sleeps out under the stars in the "broom-closet of the world." He travels from the white chalk of southern England to the gneiss of the Outer Hebrides. He even heads to the Himalayas and the limestone plateaus of Spain. He is a master of the sensory detail. He describes the "glidder" of scree and the "zawn" of a sea-cave. He makes you feel the cold wind and the hard rock.

The book is full of colorful characters and ghosts. He walks with the memory of the poet Edward Thomas. He meets sailors who navigate by the "feeling" of the sea. He shows us that paths are not just ways of getting from A to B. They are a way of thinking. They are a connection between our bodies and the earth.

His writing has a dramatic flair. He describes a walk across the Broomway—a dangerous path on the Essex coast—where the tide can swallow a man in minutes. He makes the danger feel real and the beauty feel essential. He shows us that the world is still a wild and mysterious place if you know where to look.
