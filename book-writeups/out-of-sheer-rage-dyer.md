### **[ The Author: Geoff Dyer (1958–Present) ]**

Geoff Dyer is a man who has made a brilliant career out of not being able to make up his mind. He is an English writer who refuses to stay in one genre. He writes about jazz and photography and the First World War and he does it all with a restless and slightly grumpy energy. He is a master of the "digression." He doesn't just tell you about a subject. He tells you about his struggle to write about the subject. He is funny and incredibly smart and he has a rare talent for turning his own annoyance into art.

### **[ The Book: *Out of Sheer Rage* ]**

This book is a masterpiece of failure. It was supposed to be a serious, scholarly study of the writer D.H. Lawrence. But Dyer found himself unable to start. Instead of writing the biography he spent years traveling to the places where Lawrence lived. He went to Italy and Greece and Mexico and New Mexico. He was constantly distracted. He was bothered by the heat. He was bothered by the cold. He was bothered by the way the light hit his hotel room wall.

The writing is a whirlwind of colorful detail and dramatic flair. Dyer uses small paragraphs to capture his mounting frustration. He describes the agony of choosing which pair of shoes to pack. He writes about the "sheer rage" he feels when he realizes a museum is closed or a beach is too crowded. He makes procrastination feel like a high-stakes adventure. He talks to the reader with a candid honesty that is both hilarious and deeply relatable.

In the middle of all the complaining something strange happens. By following Lawrence's footsteps and failing to write his biography Dyer actually captures the spirit of Lawrence better than any dry academic could. He understands Lawrence’s restlessness because he is living it. He shows us that travel is often a way of trying to escape ourselves and failing miserably. It is a book about the messiness of being alive and the ridiculous things we do to avoid doing what we are supposed to do.

* **Rome:** The eternal city where he finds himself more interested in his own neuroses than the ruins.
