### **[ The Journey ]**

Jonathan Raban did not just want a vacation. He wanted to test himself. He took his thirty-five-foot boat and pointed the bow north from Seattle. He planned to follow the Inside Passage all the way to Juneau. This is a thousand-mile stretch of water that is famous for its beauty and its danger. It is a maze of islands and deep channels and hidden rocks. He set out alone to see if he could handle the solitude and the tide.

Raban is a writer who sees the world through a thick lens of history. As he sails he carries the journals of Captain George Vancouver. Vancouver was the British explorer who first mapped these waters in the 1790s. Raban compares his own modern view of the sea with the terror Vancouver felt. To Vancouver the mountains were horrid and the sea was a monster. To the modern tourist it is a postcard. Raban tries to find the truth somewhere in the middle.

### **[ The Deep Dive ]**

He looks closely at the Indigenous people of the coast. He writes about the Kwakiutl and their incredible art. He describes how they saw the world as a place where everything was connected. The sea was not a barrier to them. It was a highway. He captures the magic of their carvings and the depth of their myths. He shows how the landscape dictated the way they lived and thought.

The book takes a dramatic turn when Raban gets word that his father is dying. The journey becomes a meditation on grief. He also realizes his own marriage is falling apart back home. The sea becomes a mirror for his own life. It is unpredictable and cold and deeply mysterious. He writes with a poet's touch but he never loses his grit. This is a story about the maps we draw of the world and the maps we draw of our own hearts.

He describes the water with an intensity that is rare. He talks about the "whirlpools" and the "rips" that can swallow a boat. He explains the physics of the waves and the chemistry of the mist. He makes the sea feel like a living character. By the time he reaches Juneau the reader is as exhausted and as changed as he is. He proves that travel is never just about the scenery. It is about what happens when you are alone with your thoughts.
