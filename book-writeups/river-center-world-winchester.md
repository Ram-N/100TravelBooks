### **[ The Journey ]**

Simon Winchester set out to travel 3,900 miles. He started at the mudflats of Shanghai. He ended in the freezing mountains of Tibet. He chose the Yangtze River as his guide. This is the heart of China. It is the river that defines the country. He wanted to see the old China before it vanished forever.

The timing of his trip was critical. The Three Gorges Dam was just beginning to rise. This massive wall of concrete would soon drown thousands of years of history. Winchester captures the tension of a nation in flux. He looks at the river and sees more than just water. He sees a graveyard of empires and a highway for the future.

His writing is packed with color. He talks about the legendary river pilots who knew every rock and eddy. He describes the soot-stained cities and the ancient pagodas that cling to the cliffs. He mixes his own observations with deep history. You learn about the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion. He makes the past feel as urgent as the present.

This is a story about scale. The Yangtze is a monster of a river. It is powerful and unpredictable. Winchester meets the people who live in its shadow. He talks to farmers and officials and survivors. He shows that the river is not just a geographical feature. It is a living thing that has shaped the Chinese soul for millennia.
