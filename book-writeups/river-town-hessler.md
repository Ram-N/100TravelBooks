### **[ The Journey ]**

Peter Hessler landed in Fuling in 1996. He was a Peace Corps volunteer. He came to teach English literature to college students. Fuling was a gritty and gray town. It sat where the Wu River met the Yangtze. It was remote. There were no real roads out. You had to take a boat. He was one of the first foreigners most people had ever seen.

He stayed for two years. He ran along the river every morning. He ate spicy noodles at local stalls. He studied Mandarin with the intensity of a man with nowhere else to go. The book is about his slow transformation. He went from a confused outsider to a man who understood the rhythm of the street. He captures the town before it changed forever.

The shadow of the Three Gorges Dam hangs over everything. Everyone knew the water would rise. They knew the lower parts of the town would be drowned. This gives the book a heavy sense of impending loss. Hessler writes about the "stick-stick men." These are the porters who carry massive loads on bamboo poles. He writes about the students who try to reconcile Shakespeare with the teachings of Mao.

It is a conversational and honest book. Hessler does not try to be an expert. He just watches. He records the noise and the smells and the strange humor of the people. He shows a China that was caught between its past and a high-speed future. He proves that the best way to know a country is to sit still and listen to it breathe.
