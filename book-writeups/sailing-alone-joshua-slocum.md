### **[ The Author: Joshua Slocum (1844–1909) ]**

Joshua Slocum was a man of the old school. He was a professional sea captain who saw the age of sail being swallowed by the age of steam. Finding himself without a command and "out of step" with the modern world, he did something unprecedented. In 1895, at the age of fifty-one, he set out from Boston to circle the globe alone. He wasn't a young man looking for fame; he was a master mariner proving he still had a place on the ocean. He was a man of immense practical skill, dry wit, and a quiet, philosophical spirit. He eventually disappeared at sea in 1909, vanishing into the blue he loved so much.

### **[ The Book: *Sailing Alone Around the World* ]**

This is the "Old Testament" of solo sailing. First published in 1900, it tells the story of Slocum’s three-year, 46,000-mile journey. He didn't have an engine, a radio, or a self-steering vane. He navigated by "dead reckoning" and a tin clock with only one hand.

The writing is direct, sturdy, and surprisingly colloquial. Slocum describes how he took a "decaying" oyster sloop called the *Spray* and rebuilt it by hand. He uses small paragraphs to capture the day-to-day rhythm of life at sea—the cooking of salt beef, the reading of books, and the constant vigilance required to keep the boat on course.

He has a dramatic flair for the dangers he faced. He fought off pirates in the Strait of Magellan by scattering carpet tacks on the deck to catch their bare feet at night. He describes the "thunder of the sea" and the feeling of being the only human soul in a vast, uncaring wilderness.

He provides colorful detail about the places he visited, from the "Robinson Crusoe" island to the court of the Boer President, Paul Kruger. He writes about his boat as if it were a living companion, a "trusted friend" that knew the way home. It is a story of a man who found total freedom by embracing total responsibility.
