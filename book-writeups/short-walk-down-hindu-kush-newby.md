### **[ The Deep Dive ]**

In 1956 Eric Newby was stuck in the London fashion world. He was bored out of his mind. He sent a short telegram to his friend Hugh Carless. He asked if Hugh wanted to go to Nuristan in Afghanistan. Hugh said yes. There was just one big problem. Neither of them knew how to climb a mountain. They took a four-day crash course in Wales and then headed for the border.

The journey was a comedy of errors from the very start. They hiked through the Panjshir Valley with almost no idea of what they were doing. They dealt with agonizing dysentery and feet covered in blisters. The heat was like a physical weight. The local food was often a challenge for their stomachs. Newby writes about these disasters with a dry and very British wit. He makes fun of himself on every page. He shows exactly how unprepared they were for the jagged peaks of the Hindu Kush.

Their main goal was to climb Mir Samir. It is a peak that stands over 19,000 feet high. They did not actually make it to the very top. But the summit is not the point of this book. The story is about the struggle and the people they met along the way. They encountered local tribes who had rarely seen a foreigner. They moved through a landscape that was as beautiful as it was terrifying.

The most famous moment in the book happens right at the end. They meet the legendary and very serious explorer Wilfred Thesiger. Newby and Hugh are puffing up their air mattresses so they can sleep in comfort. Thesiger looks at them with pure contempt. He calls them "a pair of pansies." It is the perfect ending to a book about the gap between heroic myths and messy reality. Newby proved that you do not need to be an expert to have a great adventure. You just need to be brave enough to keep walking.
