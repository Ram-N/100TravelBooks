### **[ The Author: Peter Matthiessen (1927–2014) ]**

Born May 22, 1927, in Manhattan to a wealthy family—his father an architect who later became spokesman for the Audubon Society and Nature Conservancy. Raised in New York City and Connecticut, developed early love of animals that would shape his life as naturalist and wilderness writer. Navy service (1945-47), then Yale (B.A. 1950), junior year at the Sorbonne. At Yale, recruited into the CIA by a professor—considered patriotic at the Cold War's height. Moved to Paris, associated with expatriate American writers Baldwin, Styron, Shaw. In 1953, founded *The Paris Review* with childhood friend George Plimpton—later admitted he "invented The Paris Review as cover" for CIA activities. Left agency shortly after, moved leftward politically, eventually came to despise the organization. The only adventure in his long life he ever regretted. Married three times: first wife Patsy Southgate (divorced 1956), second wife Deborah Love (died of cancer 1972), third wife Maria Eckhart. Deborah's death became catalyst for spiritual transformation—embraced Zen Buddhism, eventually became Zen priest and teacher. Authored thirty-three books: ten novels, two story collections, nearly two dozen works of nonfiction. First nonfiction work *Wildlife in America* (1959) established lifelong territory—destruction of nature and natural peoples by encroaching technology. Traveled extensively: Africa, South America, New Guinea, Asia—always seeking remote places offering "a glimpse of the earth's morning." Novels include *At Play in the Fields of the Lord* (1965, filmed 1991), *Far Tortuga* (1975), and Florida trilogy revised into *Shadow Country* (2008). Environmental activist, writing about Cesar Chavez, American Indian Movement, Leonard Peltier case (*In the Spirit of Crazy Horse*, 1983—controversial and litigated). Only writer ever to win National Book Award in both fiction (*Shadow Country*, 2008) and nonfiction (*The Snow Leopard*, 1979 Contemporary Thought, 1980 General Nonfiction paperback). Influenced every significant nature writer who followed—Terry Tempest Williams, Barry Lopez, Annie Dillard, Bill McKibben. Died April 5, 2014, at home in Sagaponack, New York, of acute myeloid leukemia, three days before publication of his final novel *In Paradise*.

### **[ The Book: *The Snow Leopard* ]**

Late September 1973: Matthiessen joins field biologist George Schaller on a 250-mile trek into Dolpo, Nepal—"the last enclave of pure Tibetan culture on earth"—on the Tibetan Plateau. Schaller's objective: study Himalayan blue sheep (bharal) in rut, comparing mating habits with American sheep, solving evolutionary mysteries of the species. Matthiessen's objective: harder to articulate. When a Nepalese biologist asks why he's making this journey, he cannot think of a reply. "To say I was interested in blue sheep or snow leopards, or even in remote lamaseries, was no answer to his question, though all of that was true; to say I was making a pilgrimage seemed fatuous and vague, though in some sense that was true as well." The third objective both men share: glimpse the snow leopard, rarest and most beautiful of great cats. Schaller is one of only two Westerners who has seen one in the wild in twenty-five years. The creature is nearly mythical—so perfectly camouflaged in high mountain ranges (living up to 18,000 feet) that you can look directly at one without knowing. A perfect symbol for enlightenment itself.

The book unfolds as diary entries from September 28 to December 1, 1973. But this is not straightforward travelogue. Matthiessen frequently digresses to remember Deborah, his wife who died of cancer the previous year. Their marriage had been tumultuous—heading toward divorce before her terminal diagnosis. Her death haunts every page. The book becomes meditation on death, suffering, loss, memory, healing. Questions of absence and presence operate throughout: Is the snow leopard's value diminished because they don't see it? Is Deborah more present in memory than she was in life? Can one find peace through accepting how the world is rather than desiring phenomena that do not exist?

The prose is lyrical, observational, intensely detailed. He describes cicadas whose sound causes spiderwebs to shimmer in sunlight. Mountains that serve as mirrors to one's own true being—utterly still, utterly clear, a void carrying in itself all life and sound. The tension between light and dark as the power of the universe. Figures rendered immortal by the streak of sunset on their shoulders. He names everything—plants, birds, rocks, passes—with naturalist's precision, sometimes overwhelmingly specific. The writing combines rhapsody with science, connecting the two inseparably.

The spiritual dimension deepens as altitude increases. Matthiessen is Zen student seeking the Lama of Shey at the Crystal Monastery, hoping the journey will help him transcend ego and discover who he truly is. He grapples with Buddhist concepts of impermanence, emptiness, non-attachment. Death thoughts weave throughout—not just Deborah's death but his growing awareness of his own mortality, his aging body struggling with exertion, blisters, blizzards, quaking cold. The physical journey becomes metaphor for inner transformation.

The book's climax is anticlimax: they reach Crystal Mountain but do not see the snow leopard. A sherpa named Tukten asks Matthiessen, "Have you seen the snow leopard?" "No!" Matthiessen replies. "Isn't that wonderful?" This becomes the book's essential truth—that spiritual seeking is not about grasping or achieving but about accepting absence, understanding that the search itself transforms the seeker. The snow leopard's invisibility makes it more perfect, not less.

Published 1978, it won double National Book Awards and elevated global awareness of the endangered snow leopard (fewer than 10,000 survive). Schaller's expedition helped establish Shey-Phoksundo National Park to preserve snow leopard territory. The book became cornerstone of introspective wilderness writing, influencing generation of writers blending personal reflection with exploration of remote landscapes. Critics praised Matthiessen's ability to render epic quests with unparalleled vividness and lyrical depth. Matthiessen himself reportedly disliked being called "nature writer" but acknowledged every nature writer of consequence owes him debt.
