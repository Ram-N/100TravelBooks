### **[ The Author: Antonio Pigafetta (c. 1491–c. 1531) ]**

Antonio Pigafetta was an Italian scholar and explorer who found himself in the middle of the greatest adventure in human history. He was a volunteer on Ferdinand Magellan’s expedition to find a western route to the Spice Islands. He wasn't a sailor or a soldier. He was a "supernumerary"—a man there to see the world and record it. He was one of the few who actually liked Magellan. He was a meticulous observer who carried a notebook with him everywhere. Out of the 270 men who set sail in 1519 only 18 returned to Spain three years later. Pigafetta was one of them. He kept his journals dry and his spirit intact.

### **[ The Book: *The First Voyage Around the World* ]**

This is the primary source for the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation. It is a staggering account of what happens when human ambition meets the infinite scale of the Pacific Ocean. Pigafetta captures the wonder and the horror of the journey. He writes about the "giants" they encountered in Patagonia and the strange birds that couldn't fly.

The writing is direct and often quite dramatic. He describes the terrifying mutinies on the Spanish ships and the execution of the rebel captains. He writes about the "Great Ocean" (the Pacific) which they were the first Europeans to cross. They spent nearly four months at sea without seeing land. They ran out of food and water. Pigafetta describes how they ate sawdust and leather from the ship’s rigging and rats that cost half a ducat each.

A large part of the book is dedicated to the Philippines. Pigafetta was fascinated by the local cultures. He compiled the first vocabularies of the languages he heard. He was there when Magellan was killed in a skirmish on the beach at Mactan. Pigafetta himself was wounded by a poisoned arrow but he survived to take command of the records.

He uses small paragraphs to catalog the exotic plants and animals he saw—cloves and ginger and birds of paradise. He writes with the wide-eyed curiosity of a man who knows he is seeing things no European has ever seen before. He isn't just recording a route. He is recording the moment the world finally became round in the human mind.
