### **[ The Author: Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) ]**

Bashō is the undisputed master of the haiku. He was a man who lived for poetry and the road. He was born into a minor samurai family but he chose the life of a wandering monk instead. He lived in a small hut in Edo (Tokyo) but he was often restless. He felt that the city was a distraction from the truth of nature. He spent his final years walking through the wild parts of Japan. He carried a writing brush and a small inkstone. He turned the simple act of walking into a spiritual art form.

### **[ The Book: *The Narrow Road to the Deep North* ]**

This book is a record of a 1,500-mile journey that Bashō took in the spring of 1689. He was forty-five years old and in poor health. He believed he might die on the road. He sold his house and set out for the "Deep North" of Japan. This was a wild and dangerous region at the time. He was looking for the places that the ancient poets had written about centuries before.

The Penguin Classics edition is a wonderful version of this text. It includes the main travelogue along with other sketches from his wanderings. The book is written in a style called *haibun*. This is a blend of tight and elegant prose followed by a sudden burst of haiku. The prose provides the context and the poetry captures the "soul" of the moment. It is a very short book but it contains worlds of meaning.

Bashō and his companion Sora visited temples and climbed mountains. He writes about the "summer grasses" at the site of an old battle. He writes about the sound of a cicada drilling into a rock. He is not interested in the grand or the flashy. He looks for the "eternal" in the "temporary." He shows us that a single dewdrop can hold the whole universe. The writing is direct and clear. He does not waste words.

This book is a quiet masterpiece. It is perfect for those who want to slow down and really look at the world. It is a guide on how to be a traveler instead of a tourist. It also happens to be **easily available** in almost any bookstore or library thanks to the classic Penguin black-spine edition. It is a small book that you can easily carry in your own pocket on a walk.
