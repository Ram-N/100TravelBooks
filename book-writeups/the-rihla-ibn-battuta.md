### **[ The Author: Ibn Battuta (1304–1368) ]**

Ibn Battuta was the greatest traveler of the pre-modern world. He was born in Tangier, Morocco, into a family of Islamic legal scholars. In 1325, at the age of 21, he set off alone on a donkey to perform the *Hajj* (the pilgrimage to Mecca). He did not return home for twenty-nine years. By the time he finished, he had covered nearly 75,000 miles—three times the distance covered by Marco Polo. He visited the equivalent of 44 modern countries. He was a judge, a diplomat, and a social climber who dined with kings and escaped from pirates.

### **[ The Book: *The Rihla* ]**

The *Rihla* (which means "The Journey") was not written by Ibn Battuta himself. Upon his return to Morocco, the Sultan ordered a young scholar named Ibn Juzayy to record the traveler's stories. It is a massive, colorful account of a world united by faith but divided by wild geography.

The writing is direct and often quite dramatic. Ibn Battuta describes the Black Death in Damascus and the luxury of the Sultan's court in Delhi. He has a flair for the personal. He writes about his many marriages and the children he left behind across three continents. He uses small paragraphs to describe the bizarre customs he encountered—like the silent trade in West Africa or the burning of widows in India.

Unlike Marco Polo, who was often viewed as an outsider, Ibn Battuta was an insider. Everywhere he went, his status as a *Qadi* (judge) gave him access to the elite. He provides colorful detail about the "fetish" rituals in the Mali Empire and the terrifying storms of the Indian Ocean. He was a man of deep faith but also deep curiosity. He captures the Islamic Golden Age at its height, just before the world began to change.
