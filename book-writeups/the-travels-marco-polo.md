### **[ The Author: Marco Polo (1254–1324) ]**

Marco Polo was a teenager when he left Venice with his father and uncle. He didn't come back for twenty-four years. He was not a scholar or a saint. He was a merchant. He had a brilliant memory for the price of spices and the weight of gold. He became a favorite of Kublai Khan—the Mongol Emperor of China—and served as his envoy for nearly two decades. When he finally returned to Venice, he was captured in a sea battle and thrown into a Genoese prison. There, he met a writer named Rustichello of Pisa. Marco dictated his stories to Rustichello, and the most famous travel book in history was born.

### **[ The Book: *The Travels* ]**

This book changed the map of the world. It introduced Europeans to a civilization that was far more advanced than their own. Marco describes things that sounded like magic to his readers—black stones that burn like wood (coal), money made of paper, and cities with ten thousand bridges.

The writing is direct and very conversational. Marco uses small paragraphs to catalog the wealth of the East. He has a dramatic flair for describing the battles of the Mongols and the incredible luxury of the Khan's summer palace at Xanadu. He writes about the "Old Man of the Mountain" and his assassins with the same colorful detail he uses for the pearl divers of India.

He was often accused of lying. His nickname was "Il Milione" because people thought he told a million lies about the millions of gold coins in China. But Marco was a practical man. He describes the postal system and the salt trade with the precision of an accountant. He wasn't just telling a story. He was filing a report on the greatest empire the world had ever seen. He captures the moment when the West first realized it was not the center of the universe.
