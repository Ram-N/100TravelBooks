### **[ The Author: James Salter (1925–2015) ]**

James Salter was the ultimate "writer’s writer," a master of the crystalline sentence who spent his life distilling experience into its most visceral forms. A West Point graduate and Korean War fighter pilot, Salter brought a pilot’s precision and a poet’s romanticism to his prose. He was obsessed with the ephemeral: the perfect meal, the dying light of an afternoon, and the brief intensity of youth. His work is defined by an intimacy that makes the reader feel like a silent companion on a very exclusive journey.

### **[ The Book: *There and Then* ]**

*There and Then* is a curated collection of essays that serve as a testament to Salter’s lifelong love affair with the physical world. Rather than a standard guidebook, it is an exploration of "engaged enthusiasm." Salter guides us through the high-altitude thrills of the Alps, the quiet elegance of Japanese inns, and the sun-drenched cafes of provincial France. He focuses on the intersection of landscape and lifestyle—the specific joy of a long day of skiing followed by a perfectly chilled glass of wine. It is a book for the traveler who seeks not just to see a place, but to understand its particular grace.
