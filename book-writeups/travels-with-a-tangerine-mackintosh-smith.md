### **[ The Author: Tim Mackintosh-Smith (1961–Present) ]**

Tim Mackintosh-Smith is a rare breed. He is a British Arabist who went to Yemen in the early 1980s and basically never came home. He lived in the old city of Sana'a for decades. He speaks Arabic with a fluency that shocks the locals. He is a scholar who writes like a poet. He has a dry British wit but a deep and respectful soul. He is not just passing through the Islamic world. He lives in it. He understands the rhythm of the language and the weight of the history.

### **[ The Book: *Travels with a Tangerine* ]**

The "Tangerine" in the title is not a fruit. It is a man. It refers to Ibn Battutah. He was the greatest traveler of the medieval world. He was born in Tangier in 1304. He left home to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca and he kept going for twenty-nine years. He covered three times more ground than Marco Polo. Mackintosh-Smith decides to follow in his footsteps. This book covers the first leg of that massive journey.

The author starts in Morocco and heads east. He travels through the deserts of North Africa and into the chaos of Cairo. He hunts for the physical remains of the 14th century. He looks for the tombs and the mosques that Ibn Battutah visited. Sometimes he finds them. Sometimes he finds a parking lot. The contrast between the past and the present is often funny and sometimes sad. He sketches the world of the past with vivid color. You can almost smell the spices and the camel sweat.

He travels by bus and taxi and foot. He meets holy men and hashish smokers and taxi drivers who think they know everything. He loves the Arabic language. He stops often to explain a word or a phrase. It adds a rich flavor to the text. He shows us that the past is not dead. It is just buried under a layer of modern noise.

The section on Turkey is particularly good. He explores the land of the whirling dervishes. He climbs into old caves and ruins. He writes with a dramatic flair about the rise and fall of sultans. This is not a dry history lesson. It is a lively conversation with a ghost. Mackintosh-Smith treats Ibn Battutah like a traveling companion. He argues with him and admires him. It is a brilliant mix of high scholarship and low comedy.
