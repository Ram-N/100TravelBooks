### **[ The Author: Isabella Bird (1831–1904) ]**

Isabella Bird was a woman who lived for the trail. Back in England she was often bedridden with back pain and depression. But in the wild she was unstoppable. She was a master of the "unbeaten track." She arrived in Japan in 1878. This was a time when the country was rushing to modernize. Most foreigners stayed in the treaty ports. Isabella wanted to see the interior before it vanished forever. She was a sharp observer and a very tough woman. She didn't mind the mud or the bad food. She only cared about the story.

### **[ The Book: *Unbeaten Tracks in Japan* ]**

This book is a collection of letters she wrote to her sister. Isabella set out on a journey from Tokyo to the northern island of Hokkaido. At the time Hokkaido was called Ezo. She traveled with a young Japanese guide named Ito. He was only eighteen years old but he was brilliant and grumpy. They traveled by horse and by foot through regions where no foreign woman had ever been seen.

The writing is direct and full of colorful details. Isabella describes the "miraculous" beauty of the mountains and the "shameful" state of the roadside inns. She was obsessed with the details of daily life. She wrote about the food and the clothes and the way the farmers worked their fields. She uses small paragraphs to capture the chaos of a village market or the silence of a mountain pass. She has a dramatic flair for describing the physical toll of the trip. She often wrote about being covered in hundreds of flea bites.

The most important part of the book is her time with the Ainu people. These are the indigenous people of northern Japan. Isabella stayed in their houses and recorded their customs with great respect. She was fascinated by their bear-worship and their intricate tattoos. She saw them as a noble people who were being pushed aside by the new Japanese government.

She writes with a sense of urgency. She knew that the samurai world was dying and the industrial world was being born. She captures a Japan that was caught between two eras. It is a book about a woman who was brave enough to see the world as it really was.
