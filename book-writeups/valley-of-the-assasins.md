### **[ The Author: Freya Stark (1893–1993) ]**

Freya Stark was one of the most remarkable explorers of the 20th century. While most Westerners traveled the Middle East with armed escorts, Stark traveled alone, on mules and camels, living with local tribes and learning their dialects. She was a self-taught cartographer whose maps of the Luristan region of Iran were eventually used by the British government. She lived to be 100, never losing her sharp wit or her "divine curiosity."

### **[ The Book: *The Valleys of the Assassins* ]**

Published in 1934, this book recounts Stark’s treks into the remote mountains of Luristan, between Iraq and Iran. She was searching for the legendary castles of the "Assassins" (a medieval sect of Nizari Isma'ilis). What makes the book a masterpiece is Stark's voice: she is remarkably funny, deeply respectful of the people she meets, and entirely unfazed by danger, illness, or the misogyny of the era. It is a work of both high adventure and profound cultural empathy.
