### **[ The Author: Cheryl Strayed (1968–Present) ]**

Cheryl Strayed is an American author whose writing is defined by its radical honesty. After the sudden death of her mother and the subsequent collapse of her family and marriage, Strayed found herself at rock bottom. With no experience and a heavy pack, she set out to "walk herself back to the person she used to be." Her work has since become the gold standard for the "hike-lit" genre, inspiring a global movement of solo female travelers and long-distance hikers.

### **[ The Book: *Wild* ]**

*Wild* chronicles Strayed's 1,100-mile solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mojave Desert to the Washington border. She is a "hike-neophyte," beginning her journey with a backpack so heavy she can barely lift it (which she nicknames "Monster") and boots that are a size too small. The narrative weaves between the brutal physical reality of the trail—bears, rattlesnakes, and lost toenails—and the emotional wreckage of her past. It is a story of grit, showing how the indifference of the wild can lead to a profound internal peace.
