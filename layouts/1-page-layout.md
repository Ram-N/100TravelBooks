### **[ The Author: Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874–1922) ]**

Sir Ernest Shackleton was a giant of the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration." Unlike his contemporaries who sought the glory of being "first," Shackleton is remembered for his miraculous ability to keep his men alive. He was a charismatic, deeply empathetic leader who famously prioritized the safety of his crew over the success of his mission. His leadership style is still studied today in business schools as the gold standard for "crisis management."

### **[ The Book: *South* ]**

*South* is the firsthand account of the ill-fated *Endurance* expedition (1914–1917). The goal was to cross the Antarctic continent on foot, but the ship became trapped in pack ice and was eventually crushed. What follows is perhaps the greatest survival story in human history: Shackleton and his 27 men lived on drifting ice floes for months, eventually making a desperate 800-mile journey across the world's most dangerous ocean in a tiny lifeboat to reach help. Shackleton did not lose a single man.

### **[ The Author: Freya Stark (1893–1993) ]**

Freya Stark was one of the most remarkable explorers of the 20th century. While most Westerners traveled the Middle East with armed escorts, Stark traveled alone, on mules and camels, living with local tribes and learning their dialects. She was a self-taught cartographer whose maps of the Luristan region of Iran were eventually used by the British government. She lived to be 100, never losing her sharp wit or her "divine curiosity."

### **[ The Book: *The Valleys of the Assassins* ]**

Published in 1934, this book recounts Stark’s treks into the remote mountains of Luristan, between Iraq and Iran. She was searching for the legendary castles of the "Assassins" (a medieval sect of Nizari Isma'ilis). What makes the book a masterpiece is Stark's voice: she is remarkably funny, deeply respectful of the people she meets, and entirely unfazed by danger, illness, or the misogyny of the era. It is a work of both high adventure and profound cultural empathy.
