1. The Book Concept

You’re building a curated guide to the finest travel literature. Each entry gets one or two pages. The tone should feel personal but reliable, with enough context that a reader can decide whether to read the book.

Your core elements per entry already make sense:

Author bio in a short paragraph

Year of publication

When the travel occurred

What the book covers

Why the book matters
