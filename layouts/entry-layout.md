# Entry Layout Guide for 100 Greatest Travel Books

This document provides the definitive structure for creating book entries. Each entry follows a consistent two-page format designed for both print and digital reading.

## Layout Philosophy

**Target Length**: 300-500 words (excluding quotes, bullet points, and metadata)
**Format**: Two-page spread (or continuous scroll for digital)
**Tone**: Encyclopedic but engaging, accessible yet literary
**Perspective**: Third-person analysis, not personal memoir

Each entry serves two purposes:
1. Help readers discover if this book matches their interests
2. Provide literary and historical context for appreciation
